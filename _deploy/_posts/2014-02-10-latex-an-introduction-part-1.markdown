I just finished giving the first part of my "Introduction to LaTeX" course for the [University Graduate College.](http://cardiff.ac.uk/ugc/) This is a complete introduction to LaTeX from scratch. As promised in the lecture, I've uploaded all the notes and source code, which are available from my [github page](https://github.com/martinjc/LaTeX-an-Introduction--Part-1-). Also included is the example code I was using during the lecture - by going back through the commit history you can see the changes made as we covered different topics.

Part 2 of the course is on 21st February - if you are attending and would like me to cover any particular topic, let me know by the 16th and I'll try and get it included in the lecture.
