I've just put an archive online containing GeoJSON and topoJSON for UK boundary data. It's all stored on [Github](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON), with a viewer and download site hosted on [Github pages](http://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/).

The data is all created from shapefiles released by the Office of National Statistics, Ordnance Survey and National Records Scotland, all under the [Open Government](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/) and [OS OpenData](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf) licences.

In later posts I'll detail how I created the files, and how to use them to create interactive choropleth maps.
