In December 2009 I started work on the [Socialnets](http://www.social-nets.eu/) project, working with [Walter Colombo](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=G.Colombo), [Stuart Allen](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=Stuart.M.Allen), [Roger Whitaker](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=R.M.Whitaker) and occasionally [Matthew Williams](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=M.J.Williams).

Our work initially focused on cooperation and trust between nodes in opportunistic networks and adaptive strategies for sharing content of different value between them. This work was [presented](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/research/publications/) at [IAT2010](http://www.yorku.ca/wiiat10/) and [SASO2010](http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/saso10/).

We also carried out an examination of a micro-blogging protocol to be used to disseminate small pieces of information through a population of mobile nodes. This work has recently been published in [Ad Hoc Networks](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/672380/description#description). A further paper on this topic completed as a collaboration with other Socialnets researchers at the University of Athens was published in [Pervasive and Mobile Computing](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119211001544).
