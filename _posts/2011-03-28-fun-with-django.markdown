One of the latest ideas we are working on for the new project is looking at how providing different amounts of information affects our perception of content. Â Even in pure implementation terms this is interestingly unlike any of the work I've done in the last few years, most of which was simulation based. "_Code a simulation, run the simulation, analyse the results_" has been a pattern of work since the beginning of my PhD and beyond. This recent idea however needs us to essentially survey a large number of people, so rather than just coding some command-line simulation in C/C++ (or god-forbid, Fortran) that only one or two people might use, I'm building a web based system that (hopefully) will have many hundreds of people interact with it.

From the fact that this website is just a basic wordpress install with very few changes to the default theme you can probably tell that I am not a web developer. In the recent past I've very rarely had any call to do anything web-based beyond just keeping a personal (static HTML + CSS) home page up to date here at the school. To suddenly move into building a dynamic website that does a lot of complicated database stuff and interfaces with other services via OAuth is quite a jump. Fortunately, it's been a relatively easy jump thanks to [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/).

I'm not going to ramble on about what django is (basically a python web framework), if you haven't heard of it go check it out. What I am going to do is recommend it highly. It is so simple, so quick and so powerful that implementing a web project with it is dreamy. We first discussed this research idea sometime at the beginning of the month, and I started coding it sometime around the 16th. Since then I've actually spent a week working on another project (and the ever present SocialNets deliverables for the EU), but I'm still massively into implementation to the point where I'm confident of having a site ready to beta test this week. Which I think is pretty good going for someone with as little web programming skill as I have!

So, there. Django. Try it out, it's aces.



p.s - the project will hopefully be open to the public at some point in the future, once it is, I'll post here.
