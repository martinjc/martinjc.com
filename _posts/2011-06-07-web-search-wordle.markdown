So, you've [downloaded your Google search history](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/2011/06/05/google-web-history/), what's the first thing you do? Split all the queries into individual words and make a wordle of course:

There we have it - my use of Google for five years. Turns out I do programming and live in Cardiff. Who'd have thought it?

**edit: **why have I googled for google so much?
