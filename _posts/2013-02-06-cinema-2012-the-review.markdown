## CINEMA


At the [beginning of the year I embarked upon a challenge](http://martinjc.com/2012/03/04/100-movies-in-the-cinema-in-1-year/): watch 100 movies in the cinema in 1 year. I thought it would be fun, but difficult.

It was fun.

It was difficult.

This is a not very brief account of that year, starting with the best movies that were released this year and that I saw in the cinema. In no particular order, I *think* the best movies released this year that I saw in the cinema were:



	
  * **Moonrise Kingdom**

	
  * **Beasts of the Southern Wild**

	
  * **End of Watch**

	
  * **The Hunt**

	
  * **Rust and Bone**

	
  * **Sightseers**

	
  * **The Artist**

	
  * **Argo**

	
  * **Killer Joe**


**The Artist** was really fun and original in a non-original way, showing us nothing that hadn't already been done before, but doing it in a fashion that nobody is used to, and that many people will never have seen. No, it didn't deserve the plaudits later awarded to it by the Academy et. al, but it was certainly one of the better movies this year. **Moonrise Kingdom** was beautifully Wes Anderson, full of wonderful visuals, subtle humour and outlandish scenarios, all wrapped around a strong and affecting emotional core. The acting performances from the two young leads were really good, and as usual the soundtrack was fantastic. I laughed a lot, and still chuckle now on recalling much of the film. No, it's not as good as The Royal Tenenbaums, but then what is? **Killer Joe** was strongly disturbing, a brilliant showcase for Matthew McConaughey. I'd never really thought he was much cop before, but his performance in this movie was amazing, as were many of the performances by the rest of the cast that made this brutal and depressing tale far more watchable than it should have been. **Argo** surprised me; I'd had high hopes but was waiting for them to be destroyed upon watching. How pleased I was to see that Ben Affleck had pulled it off, crafting an involving and suspenseful film that was massively entertaining. On the whole I was amazed at how well the movie managed to keep the suspense going in a movie where the outcome was already known to me. **Sightseers **was hilarious and yet brutal, a great mix. The characters were perfectly formed, the type of people you could find in any local midlands pub, but with a far darker edge than most (I hope!). The movie whipped along at a great pace, leading to the inevitable final scene that still surprised. I wasn't expecting to be as affected by **Rust and Bone** as I actually was, but I found Marion Cotillard's performance completely amazing. The depth of emotion she was able to put into the character was outstanding, and I found the film to be quite moving. A similarly brilliant character performance came from Mads Mikkelsen in **The Hunt**, a powerful film showing just how badly lives can be affected by rumour and false accusations. Again I was impressed with the acting on show, and the final few moments of the film left me with a deep feeling of unease.  In contrast, **Beasts of the Southern Wild** was just a delightful movie, I loved the semi-real dreamlike feel to the movie and was astounded again by the acting on show, particularly from the young main character. The strange parable of the wild beasts fit perfectly throughout the movie, and as an offbeat coming of age story it works amazingly well. Finally, **End of Watch** surprised me with the level of quality and realism. A `buddy cop' movie where the cops actually talk and act like real buddies was a refreshing take on the genre. Yes, the half 'found footage' half 'normal movie' style grated for a while, but upon consideration I'm giving the movie a pass because the characters were so well done and the story so well presented that it deserves it.

There were plenty of other great movies, honourable mentions are required for **Young Adult, Carnage, Headhunters, Chronicle **and **Searching for Sugarman**, plus probably others that I've forgotten. It was also a good year for more mainstream blockbuster fare, with **Hunger Games**, **The Avengers**, **Looper** and **The Dark Knight Rises** all impressing over the course of the year.

Unfortunately, having to see so many movies in a year also meant that I watched some unspeakable shit. Anyone involved in these movies needs to have a word with themselves, so, anyone laying claim to anything to do with **Man on a Ledge**, **The Cold Light of Day**, **Lockout**, **MIB3**, **Red Lights**, **Lay the Favourite**, **Expendables 2**, **Taken 2**, **Room 237**, **Gambit**, or **Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter**, consider yourself chastised. I'm not even going to grace these poor excuses for movies with reviews, but mostly they were formulaic, poorly written and poorly acted shit. Except for Room 237, which was just a terrible documentary full of utter tripe and conspiracy nuts.


## CINEMA - RE-RELEASES


I also watched a number of re-releases that I'd either missed first time around or that were getting special showings. Of these, a few really stand out and had they been released this year would probably be pushing for my best of 2012 list. In no particular order, I found **Tyrannosaur**, **The Skin I Live In**, and **Chariots of Fire **to be the best of the movies I saw for the first time as a re-release, while the special showings of both **Jaws**, and **Manhattan**, deserve mentions as they are both excellent movies that I could watch over and over again, and have, but that upon re-watching on the big screen gained something new.


## HOME VIEWING


Then there's a bunch of movies I watched at home this year that are worth remarking upon, mostly as I was watching them for the first time and found them to be completely brilliant. **Network**, **Drive**, **Animal Kingdom**, **Dr Strangelove**, **Blue Valentine**, **Brick**, **We Need to Talk about Kevin**, **Shame**, **Bronson**, **Barton Fink**, and **Moon **are all well worth checking out if you haven't already.

So, how was the year overall? Well, I watched a number of shit movies that I probably wouldn't have bothered with previously. I saw a number of great movies that I also perhaps wouldn't have seen if I wasn't doing this challenge. I missed a number of movies that I really wanted to see, but just couldn't fit in or was too fatigued to get to before they left the cinema. On the whole though, I'd say it was a positive thing. So much so, that this year, I'm upping the challenge. 150 movies in the cinema in one year. **BRING IT ON**.
