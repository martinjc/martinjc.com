[Previously](http://martinjc.com/2011/10/01/colourful-foursquare-category-icons/) I've[ written](http://martinjc.com/2012/01/31/foursquare-category-icon-downloader-2/) about a little script to download all the category icons from Foursquare and to create many different coloured versions of them. I've recently had to do this again for a project, and found my previous script did not work with a recent API version. I've updated the script to fix it and put it up on [github](https://github.com/martinjc/foursquare_icons).
