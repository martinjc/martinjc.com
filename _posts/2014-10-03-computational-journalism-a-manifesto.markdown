While Glyn and I have been discussing the new MSc course between ourselves and with others, we have repeatedly come up with the same issues and themes, again and again. As a planning exercise earlier in the summer, we gathered some of these together into a 'manifesto'.

The manifesto is online on our main '[Computational Journalism](http://compj.cs.cf.ac.uk)' website with a [bit of extra commentary](http://compj.cs.cf.ac.uk/2014/09/26/computational-journalism-the-manifesto/), but I thought I'd upload it here as well. Any comments should probably be directed to the article on the CompJ site, so I've turned them off just for this article.
