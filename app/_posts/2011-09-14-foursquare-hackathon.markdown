Along with [Matthew Williams](http://www.mattjw.net/blog/) and [Chris Gwilliams](http://encima.co.uk/) I'm helping to organise the Cardiff edition of the [Foursquare global hackathon](http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/09/09/the-global-hackathon-is-in-a-week-sign-up-now/) this weekend. I'm hoping it'll be a pretty good event. [Signup](http://www.meetup.com/foursquare-API/Cardiff-GB/340442/)'s are looking pretty positive and I'm hopeful that we'll get some decent apps being created.

The organising is actually quite fun, but it is remarkable how much there is to do and remember. Thankfully the [School of Computer Science & Informatics](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/) are being very supportive and allowing us to host it there, which makes things easier. I'll be posting here throughout the event (and afterwards).
