<p>I am Dr Martin Chorley.</p>

<p>I'm a lecturer at the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/">School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>, Cardiff University.</p>

<p>I’m programme leader for the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc">MSc in Computational and Data Journalism</a>, our innovative joint-honours degree with the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-cultural-studies">School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies</a>. I'm co-founder of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hh_swxsw"></a>South Wales x South West</a> chapter of <a href="https://hackshackers.com/">Hacks/Hackers</a>, we hold <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-South-Wales-x-South-West/">meetups</a> in Cardiff and Bristol bringing together journalists and technologists to rethink the future of news and information. I'm also co-organiser of the <a href="http://datajconf.com/">European Data and Computational Journalism Conference</a>, which was held in Dublin, Ireland in July this year, the second edition of which will be held in Cardiff in 2018. I help run the <a href="http://www.pydiff.wales/">PyDiff</a> meetups here in Cardiff, and attempt to improve student and staff involvement in the local tech scene.</p>

<p>My <a href="research/">research</a> is in the field of Computational and Data Journalism, including examining modern journalism education. I also do research that falls under the umbrella of the <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/R.M.Whitaker/">Mobile and Bio-Social Computing “group”</a>, mainly analysis of human behaviour as exposed through social network data, and interactions between people, systems and places.</p>
