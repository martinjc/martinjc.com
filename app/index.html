<h1>hello.</h1>

<img src="img/about/Headshot_2013_-cropped_small.jpeg" class="headshot" alt="Headshot">

<p>I am Dr Martin Chorley.</p>

<p>I am a lecturer at the School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics, Cardiff University.</p>

<p>I’m programme leader for the MSc in Computational and Data Journalism, our innovative joint-honours degree with the School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies.</p>

<p>My research is in the field of Computational and Data Journalism, including examining modern journalism education. I also do research that falls under the umbrella of the Mobile and Social Computing “group”, mainly analysis of human behaviour as exposed
    through social network data and interactions between people, systems and places.</p>

<p>I serve as Deputy Director of Learning and Teaching for the school, as well as Senior Personal Tutor and Student Representative Coordinator for Postgraduate students, and chair of the Postgraduate Taught Programmes Operations Team.</p>

<p>This site has details of my research, publications, teaching and the semi-occasional rambling blog post.</p>

<p>You can contact me at m.j.chorley@cs.cardiff.ac.uk, or you can find me on many social networks, links below.</p>
