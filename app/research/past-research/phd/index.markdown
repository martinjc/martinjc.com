My PhD research was focused within the field of High Performance Computing (HPC), in which I studied the performance of computational science applications and how it may be improved on modern multi-core clusters. The main focus of my research has been on the hybrid programming model, combining message passing programming (using MPI) with shared memory threading (using OpenMP).

I completed work on a hybrid MPI/OpenMP Molecular Dynamics (MD) application, the performance analysis of this code found that the hybrid model can deliver performance benefits, depending on the system interconnect used within a HPC cluster. I followed this with an analysis of a hybrid version of a real world MD application: DL_POLY. Results from both these codes have been [published](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/research/publications/) recently. Following this I worked towards creating a performance model describing the performance of hybrid and pure MPI MD codes.

My thesis was examined by Professor [John Gurd](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/john.r.gurd/) of Manchester University and Professor [Stan Scott](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/Staff/BusinessCard/?name=ns.scott) of Queens University Belfast.
