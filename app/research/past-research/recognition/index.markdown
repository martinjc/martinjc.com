[![Recognition Project Logo](http://martinchorley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/logo2.png)](http://martinchorley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/logo2.png)From 2010 to 2013 I was working on the[ Recognition](http://www.recognition-project.eu/) project. The project was mainly concerned with embedding self awareness in ICT systems, by using and understanding human cognitive principles.

Our work on the project was focused on trying to understand and classify elements of human behaviour as they relate to activities such as content consumption or geo-spatial movement. The hope is that this information can drive better recommendation systems.
