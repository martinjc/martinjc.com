                    100 Movies in the Cinema in 1 Year

        <div class="content">
            <p>After reading <a href="http://movieevangelist.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/why-you-should-see-100-films-in-a-cinema-this-year/">this blog post</a> at the end of January I decided that watching at least 100 movies in the cinema in a year was the kind of challenge I could get behind. Last year&rsquo;s challenge to get <a href="/2011/06/05/losing-weight-in-2011/">fit </a><a href="/2011/06/07/reviewmfp/">and</a> <a href="/2011/06/08/librereview/">healthy</a> was fairly successful and seemed like much harder work than going to the cinema a few times could ever be. After all, 100 movies a year is less than 2 a week, so it must be easy, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I started this project late, so at the time of reading the article and deciding to go ahead with it I was four weeks into the year and had only seen three films at the cinema. This is not the kind of progress needed for this challenge! So, I got myself a cineworld unlimited card and hit the cinema hard, aiming to get through February and be caught up to where I should be by the end of the month.</p>

<p>Of course, being a massive data geek I have been recording everything, making a note of every movie I have seen this year so far, which means I&rsquo;m amassing a fairly large amount of data on my movie watching habits, which can mean only one thing. Crappy Excel Graphs! I&rsquo;ll be posting some throughout the year to mark how the challenge is going, and the first lot are here.</p>

<p>The first shows the number of movies seen in total for each day of the year against the number of movies I would need to see in order to hit the target of 100 by December 31st. As you can see, the late start in January did me no favours, but by the end of February I&rsquo;ve almost caught up to be where I need to be.</p>

<p>The second crappy excel graph shows the movie viewing rate (the number of movies seen divided by the number of weeks elapsed) against the target rate, along with the actual number of movies watched that week. It&rsquo;s clear to see that January was a wash out, but that February was excellent and helped to bring the target rate down below 2 movies a week.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at. It&rsquo;s March and I&rsquo;ve seen 16 films at the cinema, at an average cost of £3.18 per movie. I&rsquo;m well on the way to 100 and I&rsquo;ll keep you updated with more crappy excel graphs and rubbish averages along the way&hellip;</p>

            <p>Following a conversation with <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=J.A.Quinn">Jon</a> last week, I&rsquo;ve been having thoughts about playing around with Last.FM data again, having not looked at that <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/intro">API</a> for a couple of years. We had discussed the possibility of using the Last.FM web services as part of a project at a <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/">hackathon</a> that some of the undergraduates are running in a couple of weeks time, and since I&rsquo;ve moved from primarily developing using Java to mainly using Python since I last did anything with Last.FM I thought it would be useful to develop some basic python examples using the Last.FM API.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a basic skeleton Django site that uses Last.FM for user authentication and includes a basic API wrapper for making queries. The code is all up on <a href="https://github.com/martinjc/djangoLastFMAuth">github</a> for those that are interested.</p>

            <p><em>Today I spent a good long chunk of my day shouting at my computer and trying to install matplotlib, a very handy python library. I finally solved it, so figured it was worth posting about here, in case anyone else has the same problem.</em></p>

<p>I recently updated my system python to version 2.7, so I&rsquo;ve had to go through reinstalling various libraries that I use on a semi-regular basis. Matplotlib is one of these that up until now I&rsquo;ve had no call for. However, my experiment project that I&rsquo;m working on needs some pretty graphs, so I needed to get matplotlib installed.</p>

<p>I tried to install using pip, I tried to install using easy_install, and I tried to install by downloading the source and compiling it. None of these methods worked and I was often getting compiler errors like this:</p>

<pre><code>llvm-g++-4.2: error trying to exec '/usr/bin/../llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2': execvp: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Which is very annoying. So I spent some time googling, and it seemed that the reason for these errors is that the compiler was trying to build a universal version of some library - a version that would work on both 32 and 64 bit intel macs <strong>and</strong> older powerpc based macs. However, Apple have now removed all traces of powerpc support from osX and Xcode, so the compiler was failing. There is a way to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5333490/how-can-we-restore-ppc-ppc64-as-well-as-full-10-4-10-5-sdk-support-to-xcode-4">add ppc support back to Lion</a>, but either I was doing it wrong or those instructions are slightly out of date, because it didn&rsquo;t solve my problem.  Now, depending on how I&rsquo;d tried to fix the problem, it would fail with a lot of errors in compiling &ldquo;ft2font.cpp&rdquo;. Other times it would be accompanied with &ldquo;i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.0.1: Internal error&rdquo;. After uninstalling and reinstalling Xcode for the third time I realised I was going about this all wrong. I was trying to fix the problem, rather than look for _why the problem was occuring._ Why would my laptop try and build a universal library with powerpc support if it knew it couldn&rsquo;t compile or run ppc software?</p>

<p>The answer lay with my version of python. Running</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;file $(which python)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>revealed that my version of python was also universal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;
/usr/local/bin/python: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture i386): Mach-O executable i386
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture ppc): Mach-O executable ppc
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with support for ppc, i386 and x86_64 architectures. Because of this the compiler was trying to compile all the supporting libraries as universal as well.</p>

<p>I replaced python with the<a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/"> latest version</a> (2.7.2), using the installer built only for i386/x86_64, and the problem was solved. Matplotlib built from source fine, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure (though I didn&rsquo;t test it) that I could have installed using pip or easy_install too.</p>

<p>A few hours spent swearing at the computer and an important lesson learned. Worth it.</p>

            <p>Last week I was asked by <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=Stuart.M.Allen">Stuart Allen</a> to give a talk to the students in his first year &ldquo;<a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/currentstudents/bsccompsci/">Problem Solving with Python</a>&rdquo; course on the topic of <a href="http://djangoproject.com">django</a>, the python web framework. As I&rsquo;m not lecturing at the moment I like to do these odd talks or cover the odd lecture just to keep up the skill set for when I start doing it again properly, so I agreed. Plus, I think django is ace and it&rsquo;s always nice to try and <del>brainwash students into using</del> educate students about your favourite technology :-)</p>

<p>The talk was actually really well timed as the students are currently working on a coursework in another module (&ldquo;Web Applications&rdquo;) where they are required to develop a blog application using MySQL and PHP. This meant I was able to show off just how simple it would be to do it in django instead - so I gave a quick introductory talk then did some live coding and created a pretty functional blog application in about twenty five minutes. I think it annoyed quite a few of the students to see the difference in complexity between hand coding everything in PHP and having django take care of most of the boilerplate code. It may even have been a bit evil of me, but hey, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for.</p>

<p>The slides for the talk are attached to this post (<a href="/img/{{ page.date | date: &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;}}-{{page.slug}}/django.pdf">Introduction to Django Talk</a>), although they&rsquo;re of the &ldquo;you need to be there to get the details&rdquo; style of slide design, so they may not be that useful. Thanks to Mike Cantelon for his <a href="http://mikecantelon.com/node/12">django keynote theme</a>, and the lovely flickr users who uploaded photos with a CC license so I could reuse them.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Yesterday I attended the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackday.boxuk.com/">For the Social Good</a>&rdquo; hackday, organised by <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">BoxUK</a> and held at the Students Union at Cardiff University. As you may have gathered from the title, it was a hackday themed around creating apps that had some benefit to society. The event ran from 10am to 10pm, so it was a fairly short hack event <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">compared to some</a>, which had a big influence on what could be done during the time available. In total, given the time needed for introductions and getting started in the morning, then for presentations and judging at the end of the day there was only actually about nine and a half hours of coding time, so it was quite a tough day. I went along with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voxmjw">Matt Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/whitehankey">Mark Greenwood</a> as our team and over the course of the day we managed to put together a fairly functional web app.</p>

<p>We took <a href="/2011/11/22/foursquare-hackathon-post-mortem/">what we learnt</a> from hosting and participating in the Foursquare hackathon and used that to guide what we did at this hackday. At the last event we had been slow to get going, took too long to form a team and decide upon an idea. We had aimed too high to begin with, and then also let feature creep affect what we wanted to build. Finally, our teams were far too big, meaning it was hard to divide labour up so that everyone was participating and had something to do. We finished with a working app at the end of the event, but we were determined not to make the same mistakes this time so we could get a more successful outcome. (Not that FourCrawl wasn&rsquo;t a successful outcome of course, but more on that in the next couple of weeks.)</p>

<p>Going in to this hackday we solved the team size problem naturally, as there were only three of us able to attend which made forming a small team compulsory! To try and get a good start on the day of the event we met together on the Wednesday before to have a think about ideas and a bit of a brainstorming session. While we had a lot of ideas, most of them were too complex for a short day long hack event, so unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t really come up with anything. We did have a vague idea of doing something related to cold weather though, to make whatever &lsquo;it&rsquo; was topical, given that we&rsquo;re heading into winter now. Fortunately at least one of us (not me) had obviously been thinking about it further after the meeting and on Saturday evening Matt sent round a message on G+ that he&rsquo;d found a good data set we could use for an app that would be both easy to code within the time limit, and would hit the brief for the hackday pretty well. He&rsquo;d found a dataset on <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> related to <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data">road accidents</a> that included information on weather and road surface conditions that we could use to show people where to avoid in icy weather, or to give them an idea of previous incidents in their area. With an idea starting to form we went into Sunday in a pretty good state, and ready to start coding very quickly.</p>

<p>The day started well, everyone arrived pretty much on time, which made for a quick start. Our app idea solidified easily, and early on we realised that while we had historical data to display it would also be nice to have some current updates, so we added a social element to the idea, by scraping twitter for a certain hashtag so that people could report problems with icy roads in their area, along the lines of the &lsquo;#uksnow&rsquo; hashtag that has been used frequently the last couple of winters. We were able to jump in quickly to start getting things built. Matt was in charge of getting the data into a database and building an api to query to retrieve it, using django to get a backend up and running quickly. I was in charge of building a front end map to display the data on, primarily working with HTML and javascript (and the Google Maps API obviously) and then Mark was in charge of getting the twitter scraping and postcode geo-locating working using python (so it could be slotted into the django backend), accessing the twitter API through <a href="http://tweepy.github.com/">tweepy</a>.</p>

<p>Things went really well with the implementation, I spent a while cannibalising elements from previous sites to get a frontend up and running quickly (and also thank you <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>!) and by lunch we were pretty close to starting to consolidate things together. We set a target of starting to deploy by 6, so that by the time dinner was served Matt was starting to battle his server and its stubborn refusal to allow easy deployment of django apps. Things went so smoothly in fact that we were all finished and ready with almost an hour to spare, meaning we were the only team able to slope off for a self-congratulatory pint before the presentations and judging. We headed to the Taf (a place I hadn&rsquo;t been in at least five years) for a swift one, then went back to the hackday for the final presentations.</p>

<p>Our presentation was first, and Matt demoed the app well while I played around on the laptop next to him. After us the rest of the teams went, and there were some really good apps shown off. My particular favourite was the &lsquo;<a href="http://occupywhere.herokuapp.com/">occupy where</a>&rsquo; app which allowed you to search for an &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; camp or demo near a location, then presented information pulled in from multiple sources about that particular &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; movement. A nice idea, well executed. Following the presentations the judges spent some time talking, then announced the winners. The surprise of the day was that they&rsquo;d decided our app was the best and that we&rsquo;d won! I was pretty shocked, but it was a very nice surprise. A group of first years from COMSC were runners up, and then a third year COMSC student (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/TomJHancocks">Tom Hancocks</a>) won the best individual developer prize, so COMSC actually walked away with all the prizes! After a quick tear down of the venue it was time to head to the Taf for some celebratory drinks, a satisfying end to a really great day.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I wrote this post just after the hackathon, but then forgot to actually publish it! </strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount I learnt from taking part in and helping to organise the <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">foursquare hackathon</a> here at the university that probably deserves its own post. I&rsquo;ll split it into two parts, the taking part and the organisation.</p>

<h2 id="organising-a-hack-event">Organising a hack event</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things I learnt from helping to organise the event that perhaps weren&rsquo;t clear to begin with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expect dropouts. A lot of them. We ended up with about 50% of the people that said they would attend actually attending. Which is fine because we hadn&rsquo;t planned on providing catering etc. anyway, but if we had, we may have overspent massively.</p></li>

<li><p>Get someone in to run the day that <em>doesn&rsquo;t actually want to code</em>. All three of us organising the event really wanted to get involved and create stuff, so there was no-one left to organise the other essential things like food. Too often people would talk about ordering food, or going out for dinner and then get sucked back into programming and it would get forgotten about. By the end of the weekend we&rsquo;d all eaten really badly, often very late at night. Having someone there to do things like order pizza or make coffee runs would probably have helped things go a lot smoother.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re going to be communicating with the world at large using twitter or something similar, make sure you communicate with each other within the organising team about posting updates. Often two people would try and reply to a query at the same time, which made us look a bit silly. Not a major issue, but it might help give a more professional feel, event if you&rsquo;re total amateurs.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="participating-in-a-hack-event">Participating in a hack event</h2>

<p>We also learnt a lot about participating in a hack event. My top tips for a successful project would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do your research. If you can, go into the event with an idea already, just in case no-one else has any. It&rsquo;ll help you get started quicker.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep it small. Don&rsquo;t over reach. <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> hours is not a long time to code something, and by making it too complicated you&rsquo;ll be disappointed with the outcome. Simple is best. Add extra features later if you have time.</p></li>

<li><p>Small, agile teams. These projects have to be small because of the time constraints, so if teams get too big there won&rsquo;t be enough for everyone to do. People will end up feeling useless or left out, which is never good. I would say a maximum of 4 people per team.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to learn something new, a hack event can be a great place to be forced to up your skills in a particular area very quickly. It can also be a great place to learn new skills and tools from others. However, this may lead to the end result not being ideal. If you can live with that, great, you&rsquo;ll walk away happy. I personally upped my javascript knowledge over the weekend from approximately 0 to something approaching a passable working knowledge, which was great.</p></li>

<li><p>Know your tools. This is pretty much common sense, but if you&rsquo;re not after learning something new and you just want a successful app/outcome, pick and use the tools you know really well. We went with django on the back end because myself and Matt know it pretty well, and we were able to get that part of the site running really really quickly. Had we gone with something else it may not have worked so well.</p></li>

<li><p>Get coding. Screw the design, you can worry about that later. Start coding early, and code fast.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So thats the things I learnt from the weekend. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to use this knowledge again in the future, both organising and participating in future events.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE [01 August 2014]: Even more breaking! More recent version of the script <a href="{{/2014/08/01/foursquare-icon-downloading-yet-again/">here</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 31/01/2011 - new version of the <a href="x/2012/01/31/foursquare-category-icon-downloader-2/">downloader</a> script is here</strong></p>

<p>A couple of projects I&rsquo;m working on at the moment need the ability to add foursquare venues to a map. This is pretty straightforward, but what is also needed is the ability to distinguish between the categories of the venues. To do this, I&rsquo;m adding custom markers to a google map at a venue location, with the marker having an icon representing the venue category.</p>

<p>Foursquare already have lots of category icons ready made, and they supply the urls in the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/explore.html#req=venues/categories">/venues/category</a> endpoint, which is handy.  It seems from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foursquare-api/TsRBGdXDgzg">official responses</a> on the forum that they don&rsquo;t mind you downloading these icons for use in your apps, and they also supply the icons in <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/foursquare-api/Pw0p4qqW79A/discussion">several sizes</a>, so hacking together a script to download all the available icons is pretty easy. The following python code will do just that - grab the latest category hierarchy from Foursquare, process it to extract all the category id&rsquo;s and icon locations, then download each icon in all available sizes:</p>

<p>After running this script, we have a local copy of all the category icons to use in our application downloaded. In my case, I need to be able to differentiate between venues within the categories, so it would be nice to have different coloured icons for my different classes of venue. Luckily this is also pretty simple. You&rsquo;ll need <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> installed, but if it is, the following code will go through all the greyscale icons downloaded with the previous script and convert them to whichever colours you like:</p>

<p>The colour names come from <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php">this list</a> of imagemagick colours, you can obviously pick whichever colours you want. If you run this script in the directory with the downloaded Foursquare category icons, you&rsquo;ll end up with a multitude of differently sized, differently coloured icons.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s that. Later I&rsquo;ll post about how to use these as custom markers in a google map.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3/10/11:</p>

<p>As this example stores icons by category id, it actually duplicates some of the icons, which is un-necessary. This version  stores the icons by icon name, so saving the downloading and processing of around 100 duplicate icons. It also splits the different sizes into different directories for better file management.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/10/11:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a change in the category json coming which will break this code. Use &ldquo;v=20111002&rdquo; as an extra parameter in the code that calls the Foursquare API and it&rsquo;ll keep working.</p>

            <p>Wow. I thought Saturday was busy, but I was wrong. Saturday was a cake walk compared to the crazy nightmare that was Sunday. The challenge of trying to get something (anything) working before the app submission deadline was incredible. Coding was fast and intense, and required a lot of good communication and fast thinking. Unfortunately we hit a few roadblocks that slowed us down (2 hours debugging problems with django&rsquo;s static file serving really didn&rsquo;t help, neither did jQuery mobile being an absolute pain in the rear end), but by the end of the day we had a nice looking site with some actual working functionality. Nowhere near the level of functionality that we&rsquo;d hoped for, but it&rsquo;s a start. All three of us that were working on the app towards the end are aiming to carry on the development, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll have another project to post about up here as the months go on.</p>

<p>A number of people didn&rsquo;t make it to the Sunday, which is a shame, but the core teams of both projects were in early and working hard, and by the end of the day both had been declared &lsquo;working&rsquo; enough to submit. Maybe they&rsquo;ll do ok against the competition, but we&rsquo;ll see. A couple more hours on our pub crawl app could really have helped as there&rsquo;s some key functionality missing, but there just wasn&rsquo;t time to get it working. Overall though, the event was a success. We managed to pull in people from outside our own hyper-local school development team, we all managed to learn some new things and teach some things to others, and I think most people genuinely had fun. It&rsquo;s definitely an experience I&rsquo;m looking forward to repeating, both as a hackday organiser and as just a participant. <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">BOX UK</a> have a &lsquo;<a href="http://hackday.boxuk.com/">For the Social Good</a>&rsquo; hackday coming up in November that I&rsquo;ve already registered for, and I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes open for others in the future, and for opportunities to organise more.</p>

<p>I think I learnt a few things about organising and participating in these sorts of events, so I&rsquo;ll be putting up a post in the next few days to share the knowledge.</p>

            <p>I was fully intending to try and live-blog the progress of the foursquare hackathon today, even going as far as to install a live blog plugin, but things have been going very quickly and we&rsquo;ve been hitting the coding hard so I just haven&rsquo;t had time!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve managed to get a decent crowd in, a roughly 50:50 split of people we already knew from the School and other people from elsewhere. At the peak today we had fifteen people in, but at this stage we&rsquo;re down to ten - but those who have left are coming back tomorrow! There&rsquo;s an interesting mix of skills and knowledge levels and a number of people have come who are just eager to see how other people do things and to learn more about foursquare or coding in general. Luckily everyone is talkative and keen to get on and create something cool.</p>

<p>We started this morning at about 10am and managed to come up with a few ideas in a brief brainstorming session, eventually splitting ourselves into groups working on two ideas. The first idea is being driven forward by Vlad and is quite related to the work we&rsquo;re doing on Recognition - creating a system to pull in information on a venue or location and create a &lsquo;digest&rsquo; of what&rsquo;s relevant about the place. This could come in handy later on for our research. The second idea is a more &lsquo;fun&rsquo; idea - building a system for creating, managing and participating in pub crawls. There&rsquo;s a couple of parts to this: a management website that allows users to search foursquare venues and add them to a crawl, a backend that manages the storage and retrieval of users and crawls and an application front end that allows you to participate in the crawl itself. At this stage early on day one we&rsquo;ve got most of the backend built, and the management web app is coming along well. Tomorrow we&rsquo;re going to start the android app.</p>
