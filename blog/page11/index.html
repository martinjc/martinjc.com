href=http://www.asesite.org/conferences/socialcom/2012/ >SocialCom 2012</a> and figured it was worth a post to round it all up. This is not that post however; that will take a little longer to write as there were quite a few really interesting and relevant talks to round up. I also had some good discussions about the work we’ve been doing, the work we’re planning to do and some of the work that others are doing.</p><p>This post is instead just to gather together some of the stuff I’ve done linked to the conference. I presented the initial results from our <a href=http://localhost:9000/2012/05/18/tweetcues-twitter-experiment/ >Twitter experiment</a>, which was accepted as a short paper “Better the tweeter you know: social signals on Twitter”. The slides of my presentation are below, while the <a href=http://localhost:9000/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/chorley2012.pdf>paper is available</a> (or from the <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.27>publisher</a>). The code for the experiment is on <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/tweetcues-exp>github here</a>, and the data that came from the experiment will be released as soon as we’ve finished analysis for the journal paper that we’re currently working on.</p><p>** <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/martinchorley/tweetcues-better-the-tweeter-you-know-social-signals-on-twitter>Tweetcues - Better the tweeter you know: social signals on Twitter</a> ** from <strong><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/martinchorley>Martin Chorley</a></strong></p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/07/03/talking-about-research.html>Talking about research</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>July 3, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>As someone who spends most of their life elbow deep in research, it’s sometimes hard to take a step back and view what you’re doing from the outside.</p><p>I’m pretty happy with my ability to communicate our work to a scientific audience. It’s something I’ve been trained (and have trained myself) to do over the last five or six years and so is something I find quite easy. The thought of having to explain what I do to a conference audience, or to the project partners in a meeting is something that I know I can cope with.</p><p>Explaining it to a general audience however is a different prospect. As part of some scheme or other there was a researcher from the BBC visiting the school today to see what we get up to. She stopped by our lab/office for ten minutes and I had to explain what it is we do in general terms. Explaining something like the mobility work that we’ve done is slightly tricky without having to get into details about the whys and hows of opportunistic/ad-hoc networking and mobility models. It’s especially tricky when you haven’t thought about what you’re going to say at all. Fortunately the more recent work we’ve been doing focusing on human decision making with regards to twitter is much easier, as is the personality/foursquare work that’s currently in the final stages of implementation. This work is easy to understand because it’s all about what people do and why they do it - I think a general audience can understand it easily because they have some form of empathy with the experiment participants. But communicating this work still forces you to step outside of the research and look back to see what is interesting not just to you as a researcher in the field, but to the public at large.</p><p>I think we’re fortunate in the little corner of computer science in which I work as ultimately the closer you get to humans, the more interesting the work is to a general audience, and so the easier it is to talk about and present.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/06/26/summer-projects.html>Summer Projects</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>June 26, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Both of the summer projects that I’m supervising with Walter Colombo have now started, with two students joining us for 8 weeks over summer to gain some experience of the research environment and work on some (hopefully) interesting projects.</p><p>One of our students (James) is investigating the ranking of content on Twitter by pairwise comparison. He’s currently building a website to allow comparison of tweets and hopefully we’ll be able to get enough people to have a go at it that we can gather a large number of ratings of tweets. From there we can investigate different ranking systems and do some analysis to see if we can pull out what makes a tweet “good” or “bad”. The site should go live soon, so watch this space for an announcement.</p><p>The other student (Tim) has just started yesterday and is going to be analysing retweet propagation through the Twitter social network. Hopefully this will tie into some work being done by Will (a PhD student in the school). As he’s only just started we have no firm plans yet, but we’ll maybe end up looking at some community detection or some other type of analysis to go along with this.</p><p>I’ll try and post regularly on these and keep the project pages updated throughout the summer.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/05/18/tweetcues-twitter-experiment.html>TweetCues Twitter Experiment</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>May 18, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>As I mentioned in the last post, our Twitter Experiment (called <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/twitterexp/ >TweetCues</a>) is now live. Just this morning I updated it to version 2.0 to begin collection of data for a journal paper, assuming of course that our conference paper on the initial findings gets accepted somewhere.</p><p><img src=http://localhost:9000/img/2012-05-18-tweetcues-twitter-experiment/exp11-300x199.png alt="TweetCues Homepage"></p><p>This has been an interesting project that has taken quite a long while to come to fruition. Stuart had the idea for the experiment way back at the beginning of the Recognition project - in fact the initial project document is dated from March 2011. We thought it would be a good quick easy win for the start of the project, and would get us a publication very quickly - how wrong we were.</p><p>The reasons for it taking so long to get off the ground are many. Firstly, there’s the event we don’t talk about from last April. We were also distracted by a couple of other conference papers that needed writing, and then a new idea for the next experiment that became quite distracting. There was also the small matter of closing the SocialNets project and getting the Recognition project off the ground in the first year deliverables. However, in the background this project has always been ticking along.</p><p>I actually started implementing the experiment in August and once I got going it was pretty quick. I used Django for the site, so development was quick and easy, and my git logs show a commit from the beginning of September with the message “<em>basically got everything working</em>”. It didn’t go live then, and was actually a very different experiment. There was a lot of concern over comparing tweets and showing the content - we wanted to remove the actual content of the tweet from the decision making as much as possible, so I was doing a lot of tweet analysis using AlchemyAPI to try and match tweets so they were as close as possible in terms of topics or keywords. This rarely worked. Between August and December I spent time bug fixing and attempting to improve the tweet matching, but it wasn’t really happening.</p><p>Then in December we find a git commit message: “<em>removed all the old code to start to create new version post meeting with Marc Buehner</em>”. We decided at some point that as we’re scientists that don’t generally do people-based experiments it would be good to get some feedback from someone that does, so in December 2011 we met with Marc Buehner from the School of Psychology for a meeting that produced a lot of useful ideas for strengthening the experiment, but that meant it would be easier to rewrite from scratch than to hack around at the edges of the application. It was at this meeting that we came up with the ultimate solution for removing the content of the tweet from the decision making process: <em>don’t show the content</em>. How it took us that long to come up with this solution I will never know.</p><p>By January the experiment was “<em>pretty much totally working</em>” according to my git commits, so the re-implementation did not take too long. Working out deployment onto the school web server took a little while, but eventually it was done, we went live, and collected our initial data. The findings are pretty interesting, (which will be covered in another post) but the analysis of this data revealed that we could actually do with collecting a little more information about the user interaction with the experiment - hence v2.0 going live this morning.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/05/15/update.html>Update</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>May 15, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>So, I’ve been kind of ignoring this blog, haven’t I?</p><p>Ah well, never mind.

I’ll post more in the next couple of weeks as I finish off development on this and get it ready for deployment.</p><h2 id=curop-summer-projects>CUROP Summer Projects</h2><p>Walter and I were successful in applying for some CUROP funding for a summer project looking at retweet flow in Twitter. We’ve had a lot of interest in the project, so much so that we’ve managed to convince a couple of lovely people to part with some more cash so we can take on another student for an additional summer project, this one based on Twitter ranking. I’ll post about both projects in detail once we’ve made our decision on which students to take on for the summer.</p><h2 id=mobisoc-website>Mobisoc Website</h2><p>Over the course of about a day Matthew Williams and I recently hacked together a website for the <a href=http://mobisoc.cs.cf.ac.uk>MobiSoc</a> researchers here at CU, which is now live and will hopefully start to flourish as more people get involved. It’s not much at the moment, but it could be good…</p><p>As well as those projects there’s been discussions with some friendly scientists from Cambridge about getting our hands on some personality data, the ever present EU deliverables that have needed sorting, and the logistics for the next project partner meeting in Athens in June. It’s been a busy couple of months.</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page10 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 11 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page12 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
