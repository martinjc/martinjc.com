martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Last Saturday I went along to The Globe in Roath, accompanied by my excellent musical companion Ms. Jones (and joined later on by our token northener Mark) to watch a number of bands that we’d seen before, but in a new setting. This is a review of that what happened there.</p><p>Let’s start with the venue, The Globe. The Globe is not the worst venue in Cardiff (Bogiez/Barfly, The SU Great Hall). It’s tucked out of the way in the corner of Roath, so anyone going to a gig there is <em>meant</em> to be there, which is nice. It’s an old cinema and has a lovely balcony, meaning a great view of the bands, and most importantly the sound in the place is not terrible. The only bad thing about the venue this week was that they’d sold out of tolerable ale, which is no great problem. We arrived about twenty minutes after doors were due to open, and unsurprisingly the doors were not open yet. For some reason The Globe exists in a timezone that is about 45 minutes behind the rest of Cardiff, so don’t ever bother getting there on time, it’s just not going to happen. Rubbish timekeeping and crappy beer selection aside, it’s a decent venue in which to watch a band and on this night there were three on offer.</p><h1 id=kutosis>KUTOSIS</h1><p>I’m fairly sure I’ve seen these guys a number of times before, at least once or twice at the SWN festival, maybe somewhere else as well. They’re a decent band rocking a mid-late 90’s vibe that marks them out as guys that grew up with grunge and late 90’s indie and decided the best thing to do when they started a band was to emulate that. Unfortunately you sometimes feel that they forgot to really add anything to that era, and haven’t quite managed to push things on. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a totally bad thing - they play well, they put effort into what they do, and their songs have a catchy uptempo feel. I enjoyed watching them, they were having fun and playing well, with some good riffs, tight playing and a good overall feel to the music. There are some interesting things going on with their songs, but it just feels like they need to push things a little bit further out of a safe zone and do something a bit more interesting. That all being said, they’re well worth a watch, especially if you’re like me and you grew up with grunge and late 90’s indie and enjoy that kind of thing.</p><p>This track of theirs has a real White Stripes feel:</p><p>This is a more recent track that seems in parts to show more development, it’s got more going on:</p><p>Overall they were enjoyable, played well, and I’ll give them 4 out of some.</p><h1 id=gallops>Gallops</h1><p>Again, I’ve seen Gallops a number of times before, mainly at SWN. On paper they’re not my thing, focusing fairly heavily on electronic sounds, but in reality I really love them. They’re an awesome live act and every time I see them they have something new to show. The main driving force behind them is the thundering and perfect drums; their drummer is an absolute animal, arrogant and agressive and with every right to sit behind the drumkit with the knowledge that he’s almost certainly the most talented guy with a set of drumsticks in the room. He almost imbalances the band, as with his drumming there’s not a lot the other band members can do to match his talent, which is probably one of their only weak points. The only other glaring weak point would be the guy with the mac. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, a laptop is not an instrument. If your job could be replaced with someone pressing play on a tape deck you’re superfluous, get the fuck off the stage. That aside, this band have grown massively in the two/three years I’ve been watching them, and I’m looking forward to their album in the next couple of months to see where they’re going next.</p><p>Once again these guys were great live. They clearly spend a lot of time practising getting it right, and it pays off. I’ll give them six out of some.</p><h1 id=truckers-of-husk>Truckers of Husk</h1><p>Ah, the main event. A band that I first saw at the 2nd SWN Festival, in whatever Y Fuwch Goch was before it was that (and then failed to be that and became the Moon Bar). A band that have swiftly become one of my favourite live acts in Cardiff, a band who I love going to see. Their post-rock math vibes are great, and they are another band (like Gallops) who continue to grow and push stuff forward. Their first album, (released last year) is on permanent rotation in my Spotify playlist, and I still can’t get enough of it. In case you didn’t get it, I love this band.</p><p>Today’s gig was exceptional, the band presenting themselves along with the 1924 documentary ‘The Great White Silence’, the fairly harrowing documentary about Scott’s ill fated voyage to the South Pole. Dressed all in white the band played their songs along with the film, fitting the tracks to the projection behind them, timing things beautifully to coincide with the action. I’m fairly certain they’d put the effort in to trim songs here and there to make them fit, cutting some noise here, adding some there and it all paid off. They presented themselves on stage as a band having fun and doing well doing it, but you could tell that they recognised this was (one of?) their biggest gig to date and had put the effort in to make it something special. The songs flew by and by the time the movie drew to a close, with our intrepid arctic explorers dead in the arctic wasteland and the band themselves moving the drumkit down into the crowd for the last flour covered intense burst, we were all thoroughly sated. Plus the saxophonist kept his shirt on.</p><p>This track of theirs is off the latest album and is really good:</p><p>I think this is my favourite:</p><p>I give them 8 out of some.</p><p>All in all, a thoroughly excellent night of entertainment. Top marks.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/home/2012/03/04/100-movies-in-the-cinema-in-1-year.html>100 Movies in the Cinema in 1 Year</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>March 4, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>After reading <a href=http://movieevangelist.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/why-you-should-see-100-films-in-a-cinema-this-year/ >this blog post</a> at the end of January I decided that watching at least 100 movies in the cinema in a year was the kind of challenge I could get behind. Last year’s challenge to get <a href=http://martinjc.com/2011/06/05/losing-weight-in-2011/ >fit </a><a href=http://martinjc.com/2011/06/07/reviewmfp/ >and</a> <a href=http://martinjc.com/2011/06/08/librereview/ >healthy</a> was fairly successful and seemed like much harder work than going to the cinema a few times could ever be. After all, 100 movies a year is less than 2 a week, so it must be easy, right?</p><p>Unfortunately I started this project late, so at the time of reading the article and deciding to go ahead with it I was four weeks into the year and had only seen three films at the cinema. This is not the kind of progress needed for this challenge! So, I got myself a cineworld unlimited card and hit the cinema hard, aiming to get through February and be caught up to where I should be by the end of the month.</p><p>Of course, being a massive data geek I have been recording everything, making a note of every movie I have seen this year so far, which means I’m amassing a fairly large amount of data on my movie watching habits, which can mean only one thing. Crappy Excel Graphs! I’ll be posting some throughout the year to mark how the challenge is going, and the first lot are here.</p><p>The first shows the number of movies seen in total for each day of the year against the number of movies I would need to see in order to hit the target of 100 by December 31st. As you can see, the late start in January did me no favours, but by the end of February I’ve almost caught up to be where I need to be.</p><p>[caption id=”attachment_563” align=”alignnone” width=”300” caption=”Movies Seen against Target Number”]<a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rate.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rate-300x211.png alt=""></a>[/caption]</p><p>The second crappy excel graph shows the movie viewing rate (the number of movies seen divided by the number of weeks elapsed) against the target rate, along with the actual number of movies watched that week. It’s clear to see that January was a wash out, but that February was excellent and helped to bring the target rate down below 2 movies a week.</p><p>[caption id=”attachment_562” align=”alignnone” width=”300” caption=”Movie viewing rate against target, presented with actual number of films seen in a week”]<a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ratetodate1.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ratetodate1-300x211.png alt=""></a>[/caption]</p><p>So, that’s where we’re at. It’s March and I’ve seen 16 films at the cinema, at an average cost of £3.18 per movie.

We had discussed the possibility of using the Last.FM web services as part of a project at a <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/ >hackathon</a> that some of the undergraduates are running in a couple of weeks time, and since I’ve moved from primarily developing using Java to mainly using Python since I last did anything with Last.FM I thought it would be useful to develop some basic python examples using the Last.FM API.</p><p>Yesterday I made a basic skeleton Django site that uses Last.FM for user authentication and includes a basic API wrapper for making queries. The code is all up on <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/djangoLastFMAuth>github</a> for those that are interested.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/coding/2012/01/31/foursquare-category-icon-downloader-2.html>Foursquare Category Icon Downloader (2)</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>January 31, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p><strong>UPDATE [01 August 2014]: Even more breaking!

I finally solved it, so figured it was worth posting about here, in case anyone else has the same problem.</em></p><p>I recently updated my system python to version 2.7, so I’ve had to go through reinstalling various libraries that I use on a semi-regular basis. Matplotlib is one of these that up until now I’ve had no call for. However, my experiment project that I’m working on needs some pretty graphs, so I needed to get matplotlib installed.</p><p>I tried to install using pip, I tried to install using easy_install, and I tried to install by downloading the source and compiling it. None of these methods worked and I was often getting compiler errors like this:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>llvm-g++-4.2: error trying to exec '/usr/bin/../llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2': execvp: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div><p>Which is very annoying. So I spent some time googling, and it seemed that the reason for these errors is that the compiler was trying to build a universal version of some library - a version that would work on both 32 and 64 bit intel macs <strong>and</strong> older powerpc based macs. However, Apple have now removed all traces of powerpc support from osX and Xcode, so the compiler was failing. There is a way to <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5333490/how-can-we-restore-ppc-ppc64-as-well-as-full-10-4-10-5-sdk-support-to-xcode-4>add ppc support back to Lion</a>, but either I was doing it wrong or those instructions are slightly out of date, because it didn’t solve my problem.  Now, depending on how I’d tried to fix the problem, it would fail with a lot of errors in compiling “ft2font.cpp”. Other times it would be accompanied with “i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.0.1: Internal error”. After uninstalling and reinstalling Xcode for the third time I realised I was going about this all wrong. I was trying to fix the problem, rather than look for <em>why the problem was occuring.</em> Why would my laptop try and build a universal library with powerpc support if it knew it couldn’t compile or run ppc software?</p><p>The answer lay with my version of python. Running</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>&lt;code&gt;file $(which python)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>revealed that my version of python was also universal:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>&lt;code&gt;
/usr/local/bin/python: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures 
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture i386): Mach-O executable i386 
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture ppc): Mach-O executable ppc
/usr/local/bin/python (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>with support for ppc, i386 and x86_64 architectures. Because of this the compiler was trying to compile all the supporting libraries as universal as well.</p><p>I replaced python with the<a href=http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/ > latest version</a> (2.7.2), using the installer built only for i386/x86_64, and the problem was solved. Matplotlib built from source fine, and I’m pretty sure (though I didn’t test it) that I could have installed using pip or easy_install too.</p><p>A few hours spent swearing at the computer and an important lesson learned. Worth it.</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page11 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 12 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page13 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
