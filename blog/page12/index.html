class=author><span class=date>June 26, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Both of the summer projects that I’m supervising with Walter Colombo have now started, with two students joining us for 8 weeks over summer to gain some experience of the research environment and work on some (hopefully) interesting projects.</p><p>One of our students (James) is investigating the ranking of content on Twitter by pairwise comparison. He’s currently building a website to allow comparison of tweets and hopefully we’ll be able to get enough people to have a go at it that we can gather a large number of ratings of tweets. From there we can investigate different ranking systems and do some analysis to see if we can pull out what makes a tweet “good” or “bad”. The site should go live soon, so watch this space for an announcement.</p><p>The other student (Tim) has just started yesterday and is going to be analysing retweet propagation through the Twitter social network. Hopefully this will tie into some work being done by Will (a PhD student in the school). As he’s only just started we have no firm plans yet, but we’ll maybe end up looking at some community detection or some other type of analysis to go along with this.</p><p>I’ll try and post regularly on these and keep the project pages updated throughout the summer.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/05/18/tweetcues-twitter-experiment.html>TweetCues Twitter Experiment</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>May 18, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>As I mentioned in the last post, our Twitter Experiment (called <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/twitterexp/ >TweetCues</a>) is now live. Just this morning I updated it to version 2.0 to begin collection of data for a journal paper, assuming of course that our conference paper on the initial findings gets accepted somewhere.</p><p><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2012-05-18-tweetcues-twitter-experiment/exp11-300x199.png alt="TweetCues Homepage"></p><p>This has been an interesting project that has taken quite a long while to come to fruition. Stuart had the idea for the experiment way back at the beginning of the Recognition project - in fact the initial project document is dated from March 2011. We thought it would be a good quick easy win for the start of the project, and would get us a publication very quickly - how wrong we were.</p><p>The reasons for it taking so long to get off the ground are many. Firstly, there’s the event we don’t talk about from last April. We were also distracted by a couple of other conference papers that needed writing, and then a new idea for the next experiment that became quite distracting. There was also the small matter of closing the SocialNets project and getting the Recognition project off the ground in the first year deliverables. However, in the background this project has always been ticking along.</p><p>I actually started implementing the experiment in August and once I got going it was pretty quick. I used Django for the site, so development was quick and easy, and my git logs show a commit from the beginning of September with the message “<em>basically got everything working</em>”. It didn’t go live then, and was actually a very different experiment. There was a lot of concern over comparing tweets and showing the content - we wanted to remove the actual content of the tweet from the decision making as much as possible, so I was doing a lot of tweet analysis using AlchemyAPI to try and match tweets so they were as close as possible in terms of topics or keywords. This rarely worked. Between August and December I spent time bug fixing and attempting to improve the tweet matching, but it wasn’t really happening.</p><p>Then in December we find a git commit message: “<em>removed all the old code to start to create new version post meeting with Marc Buehner</em>”. We decided at some point that as we’re scientists that don’t generally do people-based experiments it would be good to get some feedback from someone that does, so in December 2011 we met with Marc Buehner from the School of Psychology for a meeting that produced a lot of useful ideas for strengthening the experiment, but that meant it would be easier to rewrite from scratch than to hack around at the edges of the application. It was at this meeting that we came up with the ultimate solution for removing the content of the tweet from the decision making process: <em>don’t show the content</em>. How it took us that long to come up with this solution I will never know.</p><p>By January the experiment was “<em>pretty much totally working</em>” according to my git commits, so the re-implementation did not take too long. Working out deployment onto the school web server took a little while, but eventually it was done, we went live, and collected our initial data. The findings are pretty interesting, (which will be covered in another post) but the analysis of this data revealed that we could actually do with collecting a little more information about the user interaction with the experiment - hence v2.0 going live this morning.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/05/15/update.html>Update</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>May 15, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>So, I’ve been kind of ignoring this blog, haven’t I?</p><p>Ah well, never mind. I have a good excuse as I’ve been very busy working on something else, which I’ll explain in a post sometime soon. For now though I’ve made a decision to use this blog more and also to include more regular small updates on work things as well as the other stuff I’ve been doing outside of work.</p><p>So, what work stuff have I been doing lately?</p><h2 id=twitter-experiment>Twitter Experiment</h2><p>We recently launched our twitter based experiment <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/twitterexp/ >here</a>. Uptake has been very good, the initial results are quite interesting and we’re currently prepping a short paper for <a href=http://www.asesite.org/conferences/socialcom/2012/ >SocialCom</a> which I personally think has a pretty good chance of being accepted.  I’ll post about some of the initial findings soon.</p><p>Our analysis has revealed a couple more pieces of data that we need to collect, so I’ve got a couple of modifications to make to the site then we can hopefully start spreading the link a bit further to get a few hundred more respondents for a nice journal article.</p><h2 id=foursquare-experiment>Foursquare Experiment</h2><p>The initial plans for this have been scaled back and refined, but this should be online soon. I’ll post more in the next couple of weeks as I finish off development on this and get it ready for deployment.</p><h2 id=curop-summer-projects>CUROP Summer Projects</h2><p>Walter and I were successful in applying for some CUROP funding for a summer project looking at retweet flow in Twitter. We’ve had a lot of interest in the project, so much so that we’ve managed to convince a couple of lovely people to part with some more cash so we can take on another student for an additional summer project, this one based on Twitter ranking. I’ll post about both projects in detail once we’ve made our decision on which students to take on for the summer.</p><h2 id=mobisoc-website>Mobisoc Website</h2><p>Over the course of about a day Matthew Williams and I recently hacked together a website for the <a href=http://mobisoc.cs.cf.ac.uk>MobiSoc</a> researchers here at CU, which is now live and will hopefully start to flourish as more people get involved. It’s not much at the moment, but it could be good…</p><p>As well as those projects there’s been discussions with some friendly scientists from Cambridge about getting our hands on some personality data, the ever present EU deliverables that have needed sorting, and the logistics for the next project partner meeting in Athens in June. It’s been a busy couple of months.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/03/10/trucker-of-husk-gallops-kutosis-review.html>Truckers of Husk + Gallops + Kutosis Review</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>March 10, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Last Saturday I went along to The Globe in Roath, accompanied by my excellent musical companion Ms. Jones (and joined later on by our token northener Mark) to watch a number of bands that we’d seen before, but in a new setting. This is a review of that what happened there.</p><p>Let’s start with the venue, The Globe. The Globe is not the worst venue in Cardiff (Bogiez/Barfly, The SU Great Hall). It’s tucked out of the way in the corner of Roath, so anyone going to a gig there is <em>meant</em> to be there, which is nice. It’s an old cinema and has a lovely balcony, meaning a great view of the bands, and most importantly the sound in the place is not terrible. The only bad thing about the venue this week was that they’d sold out of tolerable ale, which is no great problem. We arrived about twenty minutes after doors were due to open, and unsurprisingly the doors were not open yet. For some reason The Globe exists in a timezone that is about 45 minutes behind the rest of Cardiff, so don’t ever bother getting there on time, it’s just not going to happen. Rubbish timekeeping and crappy beer selection aside, it’s a decent venue in which to watch a band and on this night there were three on offer.</p><h1 id=kutosis>KUTOSIS</h1><p>I’m fairly sure I’ve seen these guys a number of times before, at least once or twice at the SWN festival, maybe somewhere else as well. They’re a decent band rocking a mid-late 90’s vibe that marks them out as guys that grew up with grunge and late 90’s indie and decided the best thing to do when they started a band was to emulate that. Unfortunately you sometimes feel that they forgot to really add anything to that era, and haven’t quite managed to push things on. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a totally bad thing - they play well, they put effort into what they do, and their songs have a catchy uptempo feel. I enjoyed watching them, they were having fun and playing well, with some good riffs, tight playing and a good overall feel to the music. There are some interesting things going on with their songs, but it just feels like they need to push things a little bit further out of a safe zone and do something a bit more interesting. That all being said, they’re well worth a watch, especially if you’re like me and you grew up with grunge and late 90’s indie and enjoy that kind of thing.</p><p>This is a recent track that seems in parts to show more development, it’s got more going on:</p><iframe src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/bnSFv5qRioM frameborder=0 width=560 height=315></iframe><p>Overall they were enjoyable, played well, and I’ll give them 4 out of some.</p><h1 id=gallops>Gallops</h1><p>Again, I’ve seen Gallops a number of times before, mainly at SWN. On paper they’re not my thing, focusing fairly heavily on electronic sounds, but in reality I really love them. They’re an awesome live act and every time I see them they have something new to show. The main driving force behind them is the thundering and perfect drums; their drummer is an absolute animal, arrogant and agressive and with every right to sit behind the drumkit with the knowledge that he’s almost certainly the most talented guy with a set of drumsticks in the room. He almost imbalances the band, as with his drumming there’s not a lot the other band members can do to match his talent, which is probably one of their only weak points. The only other glaring weak point would be the guy with the mac. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, a laptop is not an instrument. If your job could be replaced with someone pressing play on a tape deck you’re superfluous, get the fuck off the stage. That aside, this band have grown massively in the two/three years I’ve been watching them, and I’m looking forward to their album in the next couple of months to see where they’re going next.</p><iframe src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/f2Wa491-YN0 frameborder=0 width=560 height=315></iframe><iframe src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/GV7CMZKgHbQ frameborder=0 width=420 height=315></iframe><p>Once again these guys were great live. They clearly spend a lot of time practising getting it right, and it pays off. I’ll give them six out of some.</p><h1 id=truckers-of-husk>Truckers of Husk</h1><p>Ah, the main event. A band that I first saw at the 2nd SWN Festival, in whatever Y Fuwch Goch was before it was that (and then failed to be that and became the Moon Bar). A band that have swiftly become one of my favourite live acts in Cardiff, a band who I love going to see. Their post-rock math vibes are great, and they are another band (like Gallops) who continue to grow and push stuff forward. Their first album, (released last year) is on permanent rotation in my Spotify playlist, and I still can’t get enough of it. In case you didn’t get it, I love this band.</p><p>Today’s gig was exceptional, the band presenting themselves along with the 1924 documentary ‘The Great White Silence’, the fairly harrowing documentary about Scott’s ill fated voyage to the South Pole. Dressed all in white the band played their songs along with the film, fitting the tracks to the projection behind them, timing things beautifully to coincide with the action. I’m fairly certain they’d put the effort in to trim songs here and there to make them fit, cutting some noise here, adding some there and it all paid off. They presented themselves on stage as a band having fun and doing well doing it, but you could tell that they recognised this was (one of?) their biggest gig to date and had put the effort in to make it something special. The songs flew by and by the time the movie drew to a close, with our intrepid arctic explorers dead in the arctic wasteland and the band themselves moving the drumkit down into the crowd for the last flour covered intense burst, we were all thoroughly sated. Plus the saxophonist kept his shirt on.</p><p>I give them 8 out of some.</p><p>All in all, a thoroughly excellent night of entertainment. Top marks.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2012/03/04/100-movies-in-the-cinema-in-1-year.html>100 Movies in the Cinema in 1 Year</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>March 4, 2012</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>After reading <a href=http://movieevangelist.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/why-you-should-see-100-films-in-a-cinema-this-year/ >this blog post</a> at the end of January I decided that watching at least 100 movies in the cinema in a year was the kind of challenge I could get behind. Last year’s challenge to get <a href=https://martinjc.com/2011/06/05/losing-weight-in-2011/ >fit </a><a href=https://martinjc.com/2011/06/07/reviewmfp/ >and</a> <a href=https://martinjc.com/2011/06/08/librereview/ >healthy</a> was fairly successful and seemed like much harder work than going to the cinema a few times could ever be. After all, 100 movies a year is less than 2 a week, so it must be easy, right?</p><p>Unfortunately I started this project late, so at the time of reading the article and deciding to go ahead with it I was four weeks into the year and had only seen three films at the cinema. This is not the kind of progress needed for this challenge! So, I got myself a cineworld unlimited card and hit the cinema hard, aiming to get through February and be caught up to where I should be by the end of the month.</p><p>Of course, being a massive data geek I have been recording everything, making a note of every movie I have seen this year so far, which means I’m amassing a fairly large amount of data on my movie watching habits, which can mean only one thing. Crappy Excel Graphs! I’ll be posting some throughout the year to mark how the challenge is going, and the first lot are here.</p><p>The first shows the number of movies seen in total for each day of the year against the number of movies I would need to see in order to hit the target of 100 by December 31st. As you can see, the late start in January did me no favours, but by the end of February I’ve almost caught up to be where I need to be.</p><p><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2012-03-04-100-movies-in-the-cinema-in-1-year/rate-300x211.png alt="Movies Seen against Target Number"></p><p>The second crappy excel graph shows the movie viewing rate (the number of movies seen divided by the number of weeks elapsed) against the target rate, along with the actual number of movies watched that week. It’s clear to see that January was a wash out, but that February was excellent and helped to bring the target rate down below 2 movies a week.</p><p><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2012-03-04-100-movies-in-the-cinema-in-1-year/ratetodate1-300x211.png alt="Movie viewing rate against target, presented with actual number of films seen in a week"></p><p>So, that’s where we’re at. It’s March and I’ve seen 16 films at the cinema, at an average cost of £3.18 per movie. I’m well on the way to 100 and I’ll keep you updated with more crappy excel graphs and rubbish averages along the way…</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page11 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 12 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page13 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
