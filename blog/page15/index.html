Hackathon Cardiff - Day 1</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>September 17, 2011</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>I was fully intending to try and live-blog the progress of the foursquare hackathon today, even going as far as to install a live blog plugin, but things have been going very quickly and we’ve been hitting the coding hard so I just haven’t had time!</p><p>We’ve managed to get a decent crowd in, a roughly 50:50 split of people we already knew from the School and other people from elsewhere. At the peak today we had fifteen people in, but at this stage we’re down to ten - but those who have left are coming back tomorrow! There’s an interesting mix of skills and knowledge levels and a number of people have come who are just eager to see how other people do things and to learn more about foursquare or coding in general. Luckily everyone is talkative and keen to get on and create something cool.</p><p>We started this morning at about 10am and managed to come up with a few ideas in a brief brainstorming session, eventually splitting ourselves into groups working on two ideas. The first idea is being driven forward by Vlad and is quite related to the work we’re doing on Recognition - creating a system to pull in information on a venue or location and create a ‘digest’ of what’s relevant about the place. This could come in handy later on for our research. The second idea is a more ‘fun’ idea - building a system for creating, managing and participating in pub crawls. There’s a couple of parts to this: a management website that allows users to search foursquare venues and add them to a crawl, a backend that manages the storage and retrieval of users and crawls and an application front end that allows you to participate in the crawl itself. At this stage early on day one we’ve got most of the backend built, and the management web app is coming along well. Tomorrow we’re going to start the android app.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon.html>Foursquare Hackathon</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>September 14, 2011</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Along with <a href=http://www.mattjw.net/blog/ >Matthew Williams</a> and <a href=http://encima.co.uk/ >Chris Gwilliams</a> I’m helping to organise the Cardiff edition of the <a href=http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/09/09/the-global-hackathon-is-in-a-week-sign-up-now/ >Foursquare global hackathon</a> this weekend.

As part of this, I need a basic django framework for doing authentication with foursquare. This may be useful to someone else at some point (including me when I forget in three months time how I did things), so I’ve written up the details and added the code to <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/DjangoFoursq>github</a>.</p><p>Firstly, you need to <a href=https://foursquare.com/oauth/ >register an application</a> with Foursquare to get your Client ID and Client Secret. You can enter any name and website you want, but the callback url needs to be our local development machine (assuming that’s where you’re doing the development), and to be the callback url that we’re going to specify in a minute:</p><p><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2011-09-08-django-foursquare-oauth-webapp/Foursquare-Register-300x174.jpg alt="Form to register an application"></p><p>The more observant will notice that the callback url is currently http://127.0.0.1/foursq_auth/callback/, but that the django web server actually runs on port 8000, so the url really needs to be http://127.0.0.1:8000/foursq_auth/callback/. Unfortunately the form validation doesn’t allow you to use a ‘:’ in your callback url. However, once the consumer is registered you can edit the callback url, and the form for that doesn’t validate the url (or does but doesn’t moan about the colon). Eventually, you are looking for the consumer to be registered with a callback url like this:</p><p><a href=https://martinjc.com/img/2011-09-08-django-foursquare-oauth-webapp/CapturFiles.jpg><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2011-09-08-django-foursquare-oauth-webapp/CapturFiles-300x51.jpg alt=""></a></p><p>Once that is registered, we can get on with writing the code. The basic premise is pretty simple, we need just five urls in our django app, five views to go with them, and two basic html pages, one for login, and one to show we are logged in. Assuming you have a django project started (for reference the one I’m using here is called ‘Dj4sq’) we can start by creating our foursquare app:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>django-admin.py startapp foursq_auth
</code></pre></div><p>We then want to edit urls.py for our main django project to allow the new app to handle its own views:</p><figure class=highlight><pre><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=n>urlpatterns</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=n>patterns</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s>''</span><span class=p>,</span>

<span class=p>)</span></code></pre></figure><p>and create and edit a file urls.py in the foursq_auth app with the five views we want:</p><figure class=highlight><pre><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=n>urlpatterns</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=n>patterns</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s>'foursq_auth.views'</span><span class=p>,</span>

Day Five</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>September 8, 2011</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>It’s the last full day at the festival and we wake up even later than the day before. It’s so late we decide to skip breakfast, and as it’s time for lunch we’ll head out for curry. A quick curry and rice and we’re up and running for the day once more. The shows today don’t start until later on, so we have a bit of a walk around, grab a coffee and cake, then once more split, as Lisa decides to go back to the flat briefly while I head to pub. I sit out of the rain doing the crossword, have a pint and await Lisa’s return. She arrives, we finish the crossword, and head off to the show. The first show of the day is Ruby Wax in her one woman play (that’s got two women in it): <strong>Losing It</strong>. It’s a fantastic and honest play about mental illness, really well done, with some laughs and a lot of truth.</p><p>Following the show we take a walk over to near Arthur’s seat, then back towards town for the last show of our festival. On the way we find a really ace pub that I think will be my local when I make it to Edinburgh full time. We have a quick pint, then go to the Queens Hall for <strong>Henry Rollins</strong>. The man is amazing, he gets up on stage and just talks for the evening, and everything he says is amusing or thoughtful and brilliant. He’s basically just telling us what he’s done for the last year, with some old road stories thrown in for good measure, but he’s such a great speaker its one of the highlights of the week. I think most academics I’ve seen talk could learn hugely from the passion and thought he puts into telling stories.</p><p>Post show we head back to the pub for a couple of pints, then grab a chinese takeaway and head back to the flat. With that, we’re done. Wasted, destroyed. Great week.</p><p>Shows: 2 Pints: A few Chinese Food: some Aging rock stars: one</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2011/09/08/edinburgh2011day4.html>Edinburgh Festival... Day Four</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>September 8, 2011</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>Wednesday we wake up later than intended, so miss the planned start to the day at the Shakespeare breakfast. In all, it’s a very slow start to the day, the pace of the previous few days is beginning to get to us. We head off for a walk and a bagel to wake up, and I get butter all over my face from a very lovely, but very buttery and bacon filled bagel. After soaking up a bit of sunshine in the cafe we head down to town for our first show, an adaptation of <strong>Secret Window, Secret Garden</strong>. The venue is at C soco, which is the massive hole in the ground in the Old Town where the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Cowgate_fire,_2002>fire</a> was a few years back, the one that took out the original Gilded Balloon and the School of Informatics’ AI department. The venue itself is in one of the buildings left standing on the site, which may well have been part of the University from looking at it, and the specific venue we’re in is right at the top. I estimate we climbed about 4000ft to reach it, but I may be wrong.</p><p>The play itself is nicely done, they’ve cut the story down to the minimum of necessary elements to cover everything in the plot while still bringing the play in at an hour, and the acting is pretty solid, if not stellar. The lead character is by far the best actor of the lot, doing a very good job at playing the role of the author losing his mind. They stick to the plot of the book too, rather than the film, which is pleasing. The guy playing John Shooter troubles me a little, and it’s not until afterwards that I realise it’s because he looks, sounds, and acts very much like someone at COMSC.</p><p>We’ve got a gap in the afternoon, so we head down to one of the ‘attractions’ of Edinburgh we haven’t visited yet, the Botanic Gardens. It’s a fair enough walk, mostly downhill. We cause a problem in the cafe at the east gate by attempting to buy things with a twenty pound note, the horror. They have nowhere near enough change, but there’s a solution to the problem if they let me off the odd 35p and I just pay them £5. They agree, so I effectively steal 35p of goods off a registered charity. In your face, plants.</p><p>It’s a nice place for a wander round, as lovely gardens tend to be. We decide to put up the cash to go into the hothouses, being as we’ve walked all the way down there. Surprisingly, they’re hot, and full of plants. I can’t get the Jurassic Park theme out of my head as I walk around, the whole place is reminiscent of the science labs in the sequels that have been taken over by plants, there’s a nice bit of ageing decay to them. Very few dinosaurs though, luckily.</p><p>After the botanic gardens we head to a pub down the road for a pretty decent dinner and a couple of pints, then make long trek back up the hill and into town. Lisa wants to head back to the flat, but I can’t be bothered, so I head down to the Brewdog bar on Cowgate to wait for her. I’m quite a fan of Brewdog beer, and it’s a nice bar (if a bit small), serving some very lovely booze. While I’m stood at the bar reading the paper it begins to absolutely piss it down with rain, so by the time Lisa gets back into town she is soaked through once more. As ever, the theory ‘go to the pub, not home’ has paid off.</p><p>We head up to the Assembly Hall to meet Lisa’s colleague and his wife for a pint before <strong>Sarah Millican</strong>. We have a nice chat for half an hour, then get into the longest queue yet for a show. We end up with seats up on the balcony, but it’s a fine venue that seems to hold a lot of people without feeling massive, so the view is pretty good and you still feel pretty close to the stage. Sarah Millican is good, but the show seems like a collection of one liners and jokes rather than a coherent whole. Despite that it’s hilariously funny, and a good time is had by both of us. I steal two badges at the end of the show, making it both a registered charity and a comedian that I’ve effectively cheated in one day.</p><p>Following the show we head down to the Conference Centre for an Amnesty gig. I thought the queue for the Millican show was big, but the queue at the EICC was huge, snaking all the way round to the back of the building and out into the street. I have a minor altercation with some old ladies in the queue who are queue jumping, and refuse to move when I inform them of the fact. Another chap also tries to let them know, but they ignore him too. So we talk loudly about the older generation just thinking they can do what they want, and how old people have no manners anymore and don’t understand about how being British means we treat each other decently and are polite and so on. I’m half convinced we quite embarrassed the one old lady, but her friend was made of sterner stuff. The old ladies have annoyed me massively, but it’s wearing off by the time we get into the venue, until I discover that bottles of beer at the bar are £3.80 each, which almost makes things even worse. Luckily the show is laugh balls funny. It’s basically ten minutes sets from a whole mix of comedians that we wouldn’t have otherwise seen, with a large number of laughs coming from making the signers at the side of the stage make inappropriate gestures. It’s a great gig, with performances from Mark Watson, Ed Byrne, Russell Kane, Jenny Eclair, David O’Doherty, Holly Walsh and Roisin Conaty. Once more we both enjoy it, laugh too much, and leave happy. We head home satisfied for the evening.</p><p>Shows: 3 Pints: God knows Queues: Massive Old ladies: Three (irritating and rude)</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page14 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 15 of 21</span> <a href=/blog/page16 class=next>Next</a></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=t.createElement(a),s=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-25500481-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
