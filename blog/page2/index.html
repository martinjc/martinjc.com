class=content><p><em><strong>Update 13/01/15: the paper containing the research described below is currently available from the <a href=http://conferences.computer.org/hicss/2015/papers/7367b635.pdf>HICSS website</a></strong></em></p><p><em>This post is one I’m cross-posting both here and on the <a href=https://mobisoc.cs.cf.ac.uk/ >MobiSoc</a> blog. Here, because it’s my personal translation of one of our latest research papers, and there because it’s a very good paper mostly written and driven by Roger Whitaker, so deserves an ‘official’ blog post!</em></p><p>A lot of use is made of Crowdsourcing in both business and academia. Business likes it because it allows simple tasks to be outsourced for a small cost. Researchers like it because it allows the gathering of large amounts of data from participants, again for minimal cost. (For an example of this, see our <a href=http://martinjc.com/2012/09/07/socialcom-2012/ >TweetCues</a> work (<a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581914001268>paper here</a>), where we paid Twitter users to take a simple survey and massively increased our sample size for a few dollars). As technology is developing, we can apply crowdsourcing to new problems; particularly those concerned with collective human behaviour and culture.</p><h3 id=crowdsourcing>Crowdsourcing</h3><p>The traditional <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5227025&amp;tag=1">definition of crowdsourcing</a> involves several things:</p><ol><li><p>a clearly defined crowd</p></li><li><p>a task with a clear goal</p></li><li><p>clear recompense received by the crowd</p></li><li><p>an identified owner of the task</p></li><li><p>an online process</p></li></ol><p>The combination of all these things allows us to complete a large set of simple tasks in a short time and often for a reduced cost. It also provides access to global labour markets for users who may not previously have been able to access these resources.</p><h3 id=crowdsourcingimghttpmartinjccomwp-contentuploads201409crowdsourcingimg-1024x428pnghttpmartinjccomwp-contentuploads201409crowdsourcingimgpng-><a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowdsourcing_img.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowdsourcing_img-1024x428.png alt=crowdsourcing_img></a>[</h3><p>](http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/emc_img.png)Participatory Computing</p><p>Participatory computing is a related concept to crowdsourcing, based around the idea that the resources and data of computing devices can be shared and used to complete tasks. As with crowdsourcing, these tasks are often large, complex and data-driven, but capable of being broken down into smaller chunks that can be distributed to separate computing devices in order to complete the larger task. <a href=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/ >BOINC</a> is a clear example of this class of participatory computing.</p><p><a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/participatory_img.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/participatory_img-1024x585.png alt=participatory_img></a></p><h3 id=extended-mind-crowdsourcing>Extended Mind Crowdsourcing</h3><p>The <a href=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3328150>extended mind hypothesis</a> describes the way that humans extend their thinking beyond the internal mind, to use external objects. For instance, a person using a notebook to record a memory uses the ‘extended mind’ to record the memory; the internal mind simply recalls that the memory is located in the notebook, an object that is external to the individual.</p><p>Extended mind crowdsourcing takes crowdsourcing and participatory computing a step further by including the extended mind hypothesis, to allow us to describe systems that use the extended mind of participants, as represented by their devices and objects, in order to add implicit as well as explicit human computation for collective discovery.</p><p><a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/emc_img.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/emc_img-1024x626.png alt=emc_img></a></p><p>What this means is that we can crowdsource the collection of data and completion of tasks using both individual users, their devices, and the extended mind that the two items together represent. Thus by accessing the information stored within a smartphone or similar personal device, and the wider internet services that the device can connect to, we can access the extended mind of a participant and thus learn more about his or her behaviour and individual characteristics. In essence, extended mind crowdsourcing captures the way in which humans undertake and respond to daily activity. In this sense it supports observation of human life and our interpretation of and response to the environment. By including social networks and social media communication within the extended mind, it is clear that while an individual extended mind may represent a single individual human, it is also possible to represent a group, such as a network or a collective using extended mind crowdsourcing.</p><p>By combining the ideas of social computing, crowdsourcing, and the extended mind, we are able to access and aggregate the data that is created through our use of technology. This allows us to extend ideas of human cognition into the physical world, in a less formal and structured way than when using other forms of human computational systems. The reduced focus on task driven systems allows EMC to be directed at the solving of loosely defined problems, and those problems where we have no initial expectations of solutions or findings.</p><p>This is a new way of thinking about the systems we create in order to solve problems using computational systems focused on humans, but it has the potential to be a powerful tool in our research toolbox. We are presenting this new Extended Mind Crowdsourcing idea this week at <a href=http://kholden7.wix.com/hicss>HICSS</a>.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/research/2014/11/19/quick-and-dirty-twitter-api-in-python.html>Quick and Dirty Twitter API in Python</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>November 19, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p><strong>QUICK DISCLAIMER: this is a quick and dirty solution to a problem, so may not represent best coding practice, and has absolutely no error checking or handling. Use with caution…</strong></p><p>A recent project has needed me to scrape some data from Twitter. I considered using <a href=https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy>Tweepy</a>, but as it was a project for the <a href=compj.cs.cf.ac.uk>MSc in Computational Journalism</a>, I thought it would be more interesting to write our own simple Twitter API wrapper in Python.</p><p>The code presented here will allow you to make any API request to Twitter that uses a GET request, so is really only useful for getting data <em>from</em> Twitter, not sending it <em>to</em> Twitter. It is also only for using with the REST API, not the streaming API, so if you’re looking for realtime monitoring, this is not the API wrapper you’re looking for. This API wrapper also uses a single user’s authentication (yours), so is not setup to allow other users to use Twitter through your application.</p><p>The first step is to get some access credentials from Twitter. Head over to <a href=https://apps.twitter.com/ >https://apps.twitter.com/</a> and register a new application. Once the application is created, you’ll be able to access its details. Under ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ are four values we’re going to need for the API - the  <code class=highlighter-rouge>Consumer Key</code> and <code class=highlighter-rouge>Consumer Secret</code>, and the <code class=highlighter-rouge>Access Token</code> and <code class=highlighter-rouge>Access Token Secret</code>. Copy all four values into a new python file, and save it as ‘<code class=highlighter-rouge>_credentials.py</code>’. The images below walk through the process. Also - don’t try and use the credentials from these images, this app has already been deleted so they won’t work!</p><p>[gallery ids=”1185,1186,1187,1188,1189,1190”]</p><p>Once we have the credentials, we can write some code to make some API requests!</p><p>First, we define a Twitter API object that will carry out our API requests. We need to store the API url, and some details to allow us to throttle our requests to Twitter to fit inside their rate limiting.</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>class Twitter_API:

 def __init__(self):

   # URL for accessing API
   scheme = "https://"
   api_url = "api.twitter.com"
   version = "1.1"

   self.api_base = scheme + api_url + "/" + version

   #
   # seconds between queries to each endpoint
   # queries in this project limited to 180 per 15 minutes
   query_interval = float(15 * 60)/(175)

   #
   # rate limiting timer
   self.__monitor = {'wait':query_interval,
     'earliest':None,
     'timer':None}
</code></pre></div><p>We add a rate limiting method that will make our API sleep if we are requesting things from Twitter too fast:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code> #
 # rate_controller puts the thread to sleep 
 # if we're hitting the API too fast
 def __rate_controller(self, monitor_dict):

   # 
   # join the timer thread
   if monitor_dict['timer'] is not None:
   monitor_dict['timer'].join() 

   # sleep if necessary 
   while time.time() &lt; monitor_dict['earliest']:
     time.sleep(monitor_dict['earliest'] - time.time())
 
   # work out then the next API call can be made
   earliest = time.time() + monitor_dict['wait']
   timer = threading.Timer( earliest-time.time(), lambda: None )
   monitor_dict['earliest'] = earliest
   monitor_dict['timer'] = timer
   monitor_dict['timer'].start()
</code></pre></div><p>The Twitter API requires us to supply authentication headers in the request. One of these headers is a signature, created by encoding details of the request. We can write a function that will take in all the details of the request (method, url, parameters) and create the signature:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code> # 
 # make the signature for the API request
 def get_signature(self, method, url, params):
 
   # escape special characters in all parameter keys
   encoded_params = {}
   for k, v in params.items():
     encoded_k = urllib.parse.quote_plus(str(k))
     encoded_v = urllib.parse.quote_plus(str(v))

Using it is as simple as:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>ta = Twitter_API()

# retrieve tweets for a user
params = {
   "screen_name": "martinjc",
}

user_tweets = ta.query_get("statuses", "user_timeline", params)

At the same time,  a large number associated with a tweet can also make the tweet more attractive to readers.</p><p>Our <a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581914001268>latest Open Access research</a> has discovered how much effect the information about a tweet has on whether people decide to read it or not.</p><p>By showing hundreds of Twitter users the information about two tweets but not the tweets themselves, and then asking the users which tweet they would like to read, we have been able to look at which information is more important when users are deciding to read a tweet.</p><p>We looked at two different types of information:</p><ol><li><p>Simple numbers that describe the tweet, such as the number of retweets it has, or numbers that describe the author, such as how many followers they have, or how many tweets they’ve written.</p></li><li><p>Whether a relationship between the reader and the author is important, and whether that relationship was best shown through subtle hints, or direct information.</p></li></ol><p>When readers can see only one piece of information, the case is clear: they’d <strong>rather read the tweet written by someone they are following</strong>. Readers can easily recognise the usernames, names, and profile images of people they already follow, and are likely to choose to read content written by someone they follow (instead of content written by a stranger) around 75% of the time. If all they can see is a piece of numerical information, they would <strong>rather read the tweet with the highest number</strong>, no matter what that number is. The effect is strongest with the number of retweets, followed by the number of followers, but even for the number of following and number of tweets written the effect is significant.</p><p>When readers can see two pieces of information, one about their relationship with the author, and one numerical, there are two cases to look at. When the author they follow also has a high numerical value, readers will choose that tweet in around 80% of the cases. When the author they already follow has a lower numerical value, it is still the existing relationship that is more of a draw. <strong>Readers would rather read a tweet from someone they know that has a low number of retweets, than one from a stranger with a high number of retweets.</strong></p><p>This work offers an understanding of how the decision-making process works on Twitter when users are skimming their timelines for something to read, and has particular implications for the display and promotion of non-timeline content within content streams. For instance, readers may pay more attention to adverts and promoted content if the link between themselves and the author is highlighted.</p><p><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6406256">Previous results</a>  from an early experiment were published at <a href=http://martinjc.com/2012/09/07/socialcom-2012/ >SocialCom</a>.

It is patchy, it is more than often unkempt, and it is quite ginger, but it is somewhat beard like. I can no longer remember when I grew this beard, but I like it. I like it so much that I refused to shave it off when I graduated in 2013, and again when I got married earlier this year.</p><p>However, ominous things have happened. Recently, a mate and colleague done a tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524291166615789570</p><p>“Good on Pete” I thought. Good cause. I did Movember back in 2011, and it was hard, because quite frankly with a moustache I look like a complete tit. At the time I was doing it, I think Pete and I were sharing an office, so he knows how much of a tit you can look like during Movember, yet he’s chosen to do it anyway. Well done.</p><p>Of course, you won’t catch me doing it. I have a beard now, and I won’t shave that off. Also, as I mentioned, I look like a complete tit when I grow a moustache. It was fine in 2011, I was only an RA, so I could just hide in the office and work. The only person affected was my wife, who sadly had to be seen in public with me. I’m a lecturer now. I can’t just hide in my office. I have to teach. I have to stand up in front of students. I can’t do that looking like a person who belongs on some sort of list.</p><p>Then Vince Knight joined Pete’s team:</p><p>https://twitter.com/drvinceknight/status/524532773080805376</p><p>“Well done Vince” I thought. Good cause. At least Pete won’t look so daft walking around campus with a ‘tache now. There’ll be two of you at least. Not me of course. No way.</p><p>Then Pete done another tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524533385847664640</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Pete’s called me out. He wants me to join in. Maybe we’ll just all ignore him and it’ll go away.</p><p>Then I done a tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/martinjc/status/524538880939544576</p><p>WTF? What did I just do? Did I agree to do Movember again? Why? I have no idea. Perhaps I enjoy looking like a tit?</p><p>So. I joined. As did many others that Pete called out. And now we’re all going to grow moustaches and demand money from our friends, relatives and colleagues. It’s a good cause. You can donate to us, our team page is <a href=http://uk.movember.com/team/1637929>here</a>.</p><p>First though, there’s business to take care of. The beard had to go. I had to locate my shaving equipment, which has not been used in many years, and attempt to remove the lovely facial hair to which I have become so attached, without slicing my face apart in the process:</p><p>[caption id=”attachment_1173” align=”aligncenter” width=”604”]<a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beard_removal.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beard_removal-1024x910.png alt="WHAT HAVE I DONE?"></a>WHAT HAVE I DONE?[/caption]</p><p>So that’s it. The beard is off and I am clean-shaven for the first time in I don’t know how long. This, I think, is quite the sacrifice. But there is more to come. The ‘tache is on its way - slowly working its way out of my upper lip. I am going to look terrible. If you in any way feel inclined, please make it worth it. Donate to <a href=http://mobro.co/martinjc>me</a> or the <a href=http://moteam.co/cardiff-university>team</a>. Don’t let my beard have fallen in vain.  After all (I came up with this last night while very drunk and I LOVE IT):  beards grow back. Balls don’t.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/coding/teaching/workdiary/2014/10/03/computational-journalism-a-manifesto.html>Computational Journalism - 'a Manifesto'</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>October 3, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>While Glyn and I have been discussing the new MSc course between ourselves and with others, we have repeatedly come up with the same issues and themes, again and again.
