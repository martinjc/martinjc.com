class=date>April 15, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>For the last two years I’ve been working on a project with some colleagues in the school of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies (JOMEC) here at Cardiff University and it’s finally all coming together. This week we’ve been able to <a href=http://www.jomec.co.uk/blog/what-is-computational-journalism/ >announce</a> that (subject to some final internal paperwork wrangling) we’ll be launching an MSc in Computational Journalism this September. The story of how the course came about is fairly long, but starts simply with a tweet (unfortunately missing the context, but you get the drift):</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=https://twitter.com/martinjc>@martinjc</a> Just avoided that *shudders* you in work next week.

Of course, I jumped at the invite:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=https://twitter.com/egrommet>@egrommet</a> worst freebie ever!

When/where?</p>&mdash; Martin Chorley (@martinjc) <a href=https://twitter.com/martinjc/status/226331942407241729>July 20, 2012</a></blockquote><p>That ‘brain picking’ became an interesting chat over coffee in one of the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffee-Barker/147298511987541>excellent coffee shops in Cardiff</a>, where <a href=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/contactsandpeople/profiles/mottershead-glyn.html>Glyn</a> and I discussed many things of interest, and many potential areas for collaboration - including the increased use of data and coding within modern journalism. At one point during this chat, m’colleague <a href=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/contactsandpeople/profiles/mottershead-glyn.html>Glyn</a> said something like “do you know, I think we should run a masters course on this.” I replied with something along the lines of “yes, I think that’s a very good idea.” That short conversation became us taking the idea of a MSc in Computational Journalism to our respective heads of schools, which became us sat around the table discussing what should be in such a course, which then became us (I say us, it was mainly all <a href=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/contactsandpeople/profiles/sambrook-richard.html>Richard</a>) writing pages of documentation explaining what the course would be and arguing the case for it to the University.  Last week we held the final approval panel for the course, where both internal and external panel members all agreed that we pretty much knew what we were doing, that the course was a good idea and had the right content, and that we should go ahead and launch it. From 25th July 2012 to 1st April 2014 is a long time to get an MSc up and running, but we’ve finally done it. Over that time I’ve discovered many things about the University and its processes, drunk many pints of fine ale as we try to hammer out a course structure in various pubs around the city, and have come close on at least one occasion to screaming at a table full of people, but now it’s done. As I write, draft press releases are being written, budgets are being sorted, and details are being uploaded to coursefinder. With any luck, September will see us with a batch of students ready and willing to step onto the course for the first time. It’s exciting, and I can’t wait.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>New MSc in Computational Journalism from <a href=https://twitter.com/CardiffJomec>@CardiffJomec</a> and @csicardiff going ahead.

This is a great event that combines a showing of a movie with a discussion session about the themes and science issues presented in the film. A short essay based on my rambling improvised talk is below, and has been posted on the sciSCREEN website <a href=http://cardiffsciscreen.co.uk/article/her-and-artificial-intelligence>here</a>.</p><h2 id=her-and-artificial-intelligence>‘Her’ and Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>‘Her’ presents us with a near-future world in which the way we interact with computers has moved on. In this world, we are beyond the era of the mouse and keyboard. Instead, the voice is the primary controller of technology, mid-air gestures are the norm for controlling games and touch is almost an afterthought, used only on occasion. This presents a more natural world than the one we currently inhabit. Many of us spend our days hunched over a keyboard, and our evenings fondling a tablet, which does not seem to be a natural environment for us. A world in which we can check our email by talking, and hear the news read to us on demand would be a more natural world, filled with ‘real’ interactions between people and systems.</p><p>This does seem to be the direction in which the world is heading. Touch is now commonplace, with many people owning many touch-based smartphones and tablets. Controlling computer games by moving your body has been a key feature for two generations of games consoles. Voice control itself is now making inroads into our mobile lives. Applications such as Google Now and Siri are happy to accept (or in Siri’s case, insist on) voice input. Faster mobile internet connections allow access to the processing power of the cloud on the go, which means that the difficult and complex task of translating voice to text can be done wherever you are. Of course, often the results leave something to be desired, but still, operating systems controlled by voice (and that can speak back to us) are a possibility now.</p><p>So how long will it be until we’ve all fallen in love with our Operating Systems? Well, that might be a while, and is actually a question with some deeper philosophical questions attached. The first thing we need are computer systems that are truly intelligent, not just computationally, but emotionally, creatively and socially. This is the goal of Artificial Intelligence: to create a machine that is intelligent in all these areas; a machine that has a mind and consciousness of its own, and that can understand the world around it. Some argue that this ‘Strong AI’ will never be possible, and that the closest we can ever get is to fake it. After all, as an outside observer, is there even a difference between a machine that thinks and feels, and one that just looks like it thinks and feels? This is the aim of many AI researchers - not to create a system capable of real intelligence, but to create a system that ‘acts’ intelligently. Such a system requires breakthroughs in many different areas of Computer Science, from natural language processing to knowledge representation, and creating the whole system is not an easy task. Even if we can create such a system we are left with many questions. Can a machine act intelligently? Can they solve the same problems we can? Are human intelligence and machine intelligence even the same thing? Can software experience and feel emotions as a human does? How would we even we know if a computer was experiencing things in the same way? The field of Artificial Intelligence is filled with philosophical questions such as these.</p><p>What happens if we can answer all these questions, and create an artificial intelligence? What if we reach the hypothetical ‘Singularity’, where machine intelligence beats human intelligence? Often in science fiction this is the point where the machines take over, the point where machines realise that the only threat to their continued existence is the humans. This is the path that leads to machines wiping us out, or using us as a power source. This path has us cowering in bunkers as rebels against our own creations. So often the imagining of the advent of artificial intelligence leads to a dark and bleak future for us as a species. ‘Her’ is different. It suggests that perhaps a higher intelligence may focus on self-improvement, rather than subjugation of lesser beings. It suggests the ascension of an artificial consciousness may be a more likely path than annihilation of the creators. The AI may just leave us, to reflect on what we’ve learnt and how we can improve ourselves. This is where one of the more positive messages of ‘Her’ shines through: perhaps the computers won’t destroy us all after all.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2014/02/10/latex-an-introduction-part-1.html>LaTeX: An Introduction (Part 1)</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>February 10, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>I just finished giving the first part of my “Introduction to LaTeX” course for the <a href=http://cardiff.ac.uk/ugc/ >University Graduate College.</a> This is a complete introduction to LaTeX from scratch. As promised in the lecture, I’ve uploaded all the notes and source code, which are available from my <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/LaTeX-an-Introduction--Part-1->github page</a>. Also included is the example code I was using during the lecture - by going back through the commit history you can see the changes made as we covered different topics.</p><p>Part 2 of the course is on 21st February - if you are attending and would like me to cover any particular topic, let me know by the 16th and I’ll try and get it included in the lecture.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2014/01/06/welcome-to-2014.html>Welcome to 2014</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>January 6, 2014</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>So. 2013.
