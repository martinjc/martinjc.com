class=author><span class=date>October 25, 2013</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>As part of a current project I had the misfortune of having to to deal with a bunch of OAuth authenticated web services using a command line script in Python. Usually this isn’t really a problem as most decent client libraries for services such as <a href=https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy>Twitter</a> or <a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/foursquare>Foursquare</a> can handle the authentication requests themselves, usually wrapping their own internal OAuth implementation. However, when it comes to web services that don’t have existing python client libraries, you have to do the implementation yourself. Unfortunately support for OAuth in Python is a mess, so this is not the most pleasant of tasks, especially when most stackoverflow <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12628246/how-to-send-oauth-request-with-python-oauth2>posts</a> <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15610749/github-api-v3-access-via-python-oauth2-library-redirect-issue>on</a> <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1666415/python-oauth-library>the</a> topic point to massively <a href=http://code.daaku.org/python-oauth/ >outdated</a> and <a href=https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2>unmaintained</a> Python libraries.</p><p>Fortunately after some digging around, I was able to find a nice, well maintained and <a href=https://rauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ >fairly well documented</a> solution: <a href=https://github.com/litl/rauth>rauth</a>, which is very clean and easy to use.

The presentation seemed to go really well - I think it’s the strongest work I’ve done yet, and so it was easy to talk well and with confidence about it, which led to a nice talk. There was also plenty of discussion after the talk, with a lot of good comments and questions from the audience, which suggests that most people were quite interested in the research. I pitched it as a WIP paper, describing what the ultimate aim of the project is - very much recycling the talk I gave to the interview panel for my <a href=https://martinjc.com/2013/08/16/epsrc-doctoral-award-fellowship/ >fellowship</a> proposal. I think it certainly got a few people interested who’ll look to follow the project as it unfolds over the next couple of months.</p><p>After lunch there was an extra bonus when we discovered a beer vending machine in the hotel - what better way to celebrate a successful conference presentation than a cold beer in the sun?</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2013/10/01/csar-workshop.html>CSAR Workshop</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>October 1, 2013</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>This week, as part of the “<a href=http://socialcloud.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/confs/SCA2013/ >Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications</a>” we held a workshop “<a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/csar/ >Collective Social Awareness and Relevance (CSAR)</a>”. Organising the workshop (along with Walter Colombo) over the last couple of months has been an interesting process - this is the first time I’ve had the chance to get involved in “real” workshop organisation, so this is the first time I’ve seen the process up close. It’s a very involved process: from deciding upon and inviting Program Committee members, publicising the workshop, soliciting submissions, and navigating through the review process and getting a set of accepted papers it’s been a fair challenge. Really it wouldn’t have been possible without Walter doing such a good job of pushing the PC members to get their reviews done, he really drove that whole process, so I could sit back a bit there.</p><p>We ended up with 3 good papers accepted, which were presented in a session yesterday morning. The talks were informative and useful, and generated a good number of questions and discussion, which is really all you can hope for. It was also my first time chairing a session at a conference, which was fairly daunting, but turned out to be fairly easy and interesting. It was nice to be the one asking the difficult questions at the end of the presentation, rather than being on the receiving end.</p><p>Overall the workshop went very well. I wasn’t sure beforehand whether we’d try and run it again, but actually now I think it would be a shame not to. I’ll keep my eyes out for a conference that we can latch onto sometime next year.</p></div></article><hr><article class=blogpost><header><h1><a href=/2013/09/24/ksri-services-summer-school-social-computing-theory-and-hackathon.html>KSRI Services Summer School - Social Computing Theory and Hackathon</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>September 24, 2013</span> - by martin</p></header><div class=content><p>I was invited by <a href="http://www.ksri.kit.edu/Default.aspx?PageId=691&amp;lang=en">Simon Caton</a> to come to the <a href="http://www.ksri.kit.edu/Default.aspx?lang=en">KSRI</a> <a href=http://service-summer.ksri.kit.edu/62.php>Services Summer School</a>, held at <a href=http://www.kit.edu/index.php>KIT</a> in Germany, to help him run a workshop session on <a href=http://service-summer.ksri.kit.edu/104.php>Social Computing</a>.  We decided to use the session as a crash course in retrieving and manipulating data from Social Media APIs - showing the students the basics, then running a mini ‘hackathon’ for the students to gain some practical experience.</p><p>I think the session went really well, the students seemed to enjoy it and the feedback was very positive. We spent about 90 minutes talking about APIs, JSON, Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare, then set the students off on forming teams and brainstorming ideas. Very quickly they managed to get set up grabbing Twitter data from the streaming API, and coming up with ways of analysing it for interesting facts and statistics.  A number of the students were not coders, and had never done anything like this before, so it was great to see them diving in, setting up servers and running php scripts to grab the data. It was also good to see the level of team work on display; everyone was communicating, dividing the work, and getting on well. Fuelled by a combination of pizza, beer, red bull and haribo they coded into the night, until we drew things to a close at about 10pm and retired to the nearest bar for a pint of debrief.</p><p><img src=https://martinjc.com/img/2013-09-24-ksri-services-summer-school-social-computing-theory-and-hackathon/2013-09-23-18.03.23-1024x768.jpg alt="Hackathon Students"></p><p>It was a really good experience, and I think everyone got something useful out of it. I’m looking forward to the presentations later on today to see what everyone came up with.</p><p>Our slides from the talk are available on <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/karlsruheserviceresearchinstitute/social-computing-analysing-social-media-theory-and-hackathon>slideshare</a>.

(It should be noted that the ‘IMAX” bit  doesn’t mean much -  the screen at the Odeon is <a href=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14361/the-incredible-shrinking-imax-screen>nowhere near as big as a true ‘IMAX’ screen</a>). I should say, I love this film <em>a lot</em> - hence my willingness to pay £12 (£12!!??!) to see it again on the big screen. I first saw it in the Shrewsbury Empire cinema when I was 10 years old, in one of my first (and possibly only) trips to the cinema with my Dad, and instantly loved it. This is not entirely unsurprising considering I was essentially the target audience at the time. Following that I wore through a pirate VHS copy obtained from a friend, then an actual legitimate VHS copy, followed by the inevitable much hardier DVD purchase. When we finally embraced streaming media a couple of years ago and sold off all the DVDs it was one of only a few that I was desperate to keep. I like the movie so much that I can even forgive Jurassic Park 2 and 3.</p><p>It’s sad then for me to see the movie in this format now. From minute 1, it’s clear that the 3D conversion is very poor quality. It’s basically like watching a moving pop up book, as flat characters and objects make their way across the screen at varying depths. At some points individual characters have been picked out of the background so poorly it actually looks like they’ve been filmed with early green-screen effects, so they’re totally divorced from the background. It just doesn’t add anything to the movie, and is actually often distracting. It’s a waste of the already impressive visuals of the movie, and so easy to see it for what it is: a cheap gimmick to try and cash in on a successful property. The problem is that it’s totally unnecessary - all that’s needed to get a bunch of new film goers interested in Jurassic Park (and become the ready made audience for the next ‘new’ JP movie) is to release the film again. I’m sure it would have done just as well as a 2D re-release, so this poor 3D affair is a waste of effort.</p><p>Of course the film itself is still amazing, and the sound quality (whether due to this new version or because of the IMAX standard speaker system) absolutely blew me away. I heard lines of dialogue that were previously just characters muttering under their breath, and the roar of the dinosaurs combined with <em>that</em> John Williams theme made me forgive the awful awful 3d conversion and fall in love with the movie all over again.</p><p>Also the raptors are still bloody terrifying.</p></div></article><hr><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/page6 class=previous>Previous</a> <span class=page_number>Page: 7 of 20</span> <a href=/blog/page8 class=next>Next</a></div></div></body></html>
