We had discussed the possibility of using the Last.FM web services as part of a project at a <a href=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/ >hackathon</a> that some of the undergraduates are running in a couple of weeks time, and since I’ve moved from primarily developing using Java to mainly using Python since I last did anything with Last.FM I thought it would be useful to develop some basic python examples using the Last.FM API.</p><p>Yesterday I made a basic skeleton Django site that uses Last.FM for user authentication and includes a basic API wrapper for making queries. The code is all up on <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/djangoLastFMAuth>github</a> for those that are interested.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
