It’s the highlight of the musical year in Cardiff, and probably the one thing I’ll miss about the city when (if?) I leave. In fact, I’m pretty certain that even if I left the city I’d make the pilgrimage back once a year for SWN because it’s just too much fun to miss.</p><p>The lineup this year is another cracking one, but as usual with four days of bands spread across so many venues there are a whole bunch of names that I don’t recognise. As per usual I’ve cooked up a <a href=http://open.spotify.com/user/martinjc/playlist/4O56MWAi1qIO6XfCDXEtjG>Spotify playlist</a>, but even sorting through that takes some time:</p><p>I decided this year that it would be nice to have an easy visual way to see what the bands are like, so decided to build myself a little <a href=http://martinjc.com/swn/ >artist explorer</a>. This uses tags from <a href=www.last.fm>Last.FM</a> and generates word clouds using a nice <a href=https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud>javascript plugin</a> for <a href=http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ >d3</a> written by <a href=http://www.jasondavies.com/ >Jason Davies</a>. Most of the word cloud js was hacked together from Jason’s <a href=http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/ >example</a>, with some mangling and modification from me. I downloaded the tags for artists offline and stuck them in a .json file so it doesn’t hit the Last.FM servers on every page load. What we end up with is a fairly simple tag cloud example that allows you to see at a glance how Last.FM users have categorised the bands. Selecting a tag in the word cloud will show you the other bands in the lineup that have also had that tag applied to them. Screenshots of the site are below:</p><p>[gallery link=”file”]</p><p>but of course it’s also <a href=http://martinjc.com/swn>online here</a>!</p><p>Meanwhile, the code is available on <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/swn_tagger>github</a>, with no guarantees that any of it actually works.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
