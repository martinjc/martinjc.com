In a temporary fit of insanity I decided it would be nice to write all the slides in LaTeX, so that I can distribute the source to the students so they get some real world LaTeX examples to go along with the course notes.</p><p>I was attempting to make handouts for the students using the great <a href=http://www.guidodiepen.nl/2009/07/creating-latex-beamer-handouts-with-notes/ >handoutWithNotes</a> package. However, as my slides are white, they looked a bit odd on a page without a frame around them:</p><p><a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-09.40.18.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-09.40.18.png alt="Slides without border"></a></p><p>I wanted to add a border to make the handouts look better, but there were no suggestions at the <a href=http://www.guidodiepen.nl/2009/07/creating-latex-beamer-handouts-with-notes/ >site I got the package from</a> as to how to add a frame, and I’m too lazy to go digging in CTAN to see if there’s any documentation.</p><p>Instead, a little bit of googling (thank you<a href=http://tex.stackexchange.com/ > tex.stackexchange</a>!) revealed <a href=http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/74637/problem-with-drawing-borders-around-slides-in-latex-beamer-handouts-with-adobe-r>the answer</a>:</p><div class=highlighter-rouge><pre class=highlight><code>\pgfpageslogicalpageoptions{1}{border code=\pgfusepath{stroke}}
\pgfpageslogicalpageoptions{2}{border code=\pgfusepath{stroke}}
\pgfpageslogicalpageoptions{3}{border code=\pgfusepath{stroke}}
</code></pre></div><p>You’ll need one command for each slide on a page, and you get simple frames around the slides:</p><p><a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-09.43.19.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-09.43.19.png alt="Handouts with Frames"></a>Easy!</p></div></div></div></body></html>
