<p>I am Dr Martin Chorley.</p>

<p>I'm a Senior Lecturer at the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/">School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>, Cardiff University. <p>I am the Director of Learning and Teaching for the school.</p>

<p>I’m programme leader for the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc">MSc in Computational and Data Journalism</a>, our innovative joint-honours degree with the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture">School of Journalism, Media and Culture</a>.
