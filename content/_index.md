<h1>hello.</h1>

<img src="img/Headshot_2013_-cropped_small.jpeg" class="headshot" alt="Headshot">

<p>I am Dr Martin Chorley.</p>

<p>I'm a Senior Lecturer at the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/">School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>, Cardiff University. I am the Director of Learning and Teaching for the school, which means I look after our Undergraduate and Taught Postgraduate programmes and students.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m programme leader for the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc">MSc in Computational and Data Journalism</a>, our innovative joint-honours degree with the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture">School of Journalism, Media and Culture (JOMEC)</a>. I helped design the course with colleagues from JOMEC and teach on some of the modules.</p>

<p>I'm co-organiser of the <a href="http://datajconf.com/">European Data and Computational Journalism Conference</a>, the third edition of which was held in Malaga in 2019. I help run the <a href="http://www.pydiff.wales/">PyDiff</a> meetups here in Cardiff, and attempt to improve student and staff involvement in the local tech scene. I'm also co-founder of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hh_swxsw"></a>South Wales x South West</a> chapter of <a href="https://hackshackers.com/">Hacks/Hackers</a>, we hold <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-South-Wales-x-South-West/">meetups</a> in Cardiff and Bristol bringing together journalists and technologists to rethink the future of news and information. </p>

<p>I'm interested in people and computers, so that is where most of my research is focused. A lot of my recent <a href="research/">research</a> is looking at modern journalism and computer science education, with work in the area of Computational and Data Journalism. I have recently formed a Computer Science Scholarship group in the School, which is aiming to improve knowledge transfer of innovative and best-practice Computer Science teaching both inside and outside the School, and to carry out more research around Computer Science and Software Engineering education. I am also interested in analysis of human behaviour as exposed through social network data, and interactions between people, systems and places.</p>

<p>This site has details of my <a href="research/">research</a>, <a href="publications/">publications</a>, <a href="teaching/">teaching</a> and the semi-occasional rambling <a href="blog/">blog</a> post.</p>
