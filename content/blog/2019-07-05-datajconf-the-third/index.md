Last week we held the third edition of the European Data and Computational Journalism Conference, in Malaga, Spain. It was a truly fantastic event, with around 100 attendees representing different organisations from industry and academia. When Bahareh initially pitched the idea to me of running a conference in this field, one of the main drivers for us was to encourage a mix of industry and academia, as we think the conference can be more useful this way, rather than as a purely academic or industry focused event. It has been a great pleasure to see this happen over the last three years, with both academics and practitioners putting forward talk proposals, coming along to the conference, and starting what I hope are interesting and fruitful conversations.

There were some truly interesting talks on both days, and some very interesting practical workshops too. Our keynotes, Daniele Grasso and Meredith Broussard did fantastic jobs of opening and closing our first day of talks.
