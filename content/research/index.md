I'm currently very interested in the understanding of educational methods (including the use of innovative teaching and assessment) particularly within STEM subjects, but also at the cross-disciplinary boundary. A large focus of my current research is in the area of Computational and Data Journalism, including studying Data Journalism and Computer Science education.

I like doing research wherever computer science, IT systems and devices brush up against the real world, as things are far more interesting when people are involved. My research is therefore cross-disciplinary, mainly in the area of human behaviour, looking at social, mobile and pervasive computing and information dissemination - if there's a scenario where people and computers mix and interact, that's where I get involved. I'm very keen on investigating the use of computer science, social media, and data science within Journalism, as both a tool for improving communication and storytelling, and as an input and tool for data gathering, story creation and newsroom workflows. I have a background in high performance computing.


## Current Research

My recent research has looked at issues of communication within and outside of the Journalism community. I have also been examining what social media can tell us about alcohol consumption.

Before I began work as a Lecturer I was working on a 12 month EPSRC Fellowship (2013 Doctoral Award Prize) examining the relationship between an individual's personality (in terms of the OCEAN five-factor personality model) and the places they visit or check in to. This work has been [published](/publications/)

## Reviewing and Committees

I have served as reviewer and on committees for many journals and conferences.

### Journals

I'm guest editor for a special issue of the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction: "[Following User Pathways](http://explore.tandfonline.com/cfp/est/hihc-cfb-8.2016)".

I have reviewed for the following journals:

  * ACM Transactions on Internet Technology
  * WWW
  * Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience
  * Computer Communications
  * Computer Physics Communications
  * Journal of Computational Science
  * International Journal of Human-Computer Studies
  * ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

### Conference/Workshop Committees

I have served on various committees for conferences and workshops:


  * I'm co-organiser of the [European Data and Computational Journalism Conference](http://datajconf.com/), held in Dublin in 2017, Cardiff in 2018, and Malaga in 2019.
  * I was a member of the Organising Committee for the "[Following User Pathways: Cross Platform and Mixed Methods Analysis in Social Media Studies](http://www.ksri.kit.edu/1516.php)" workshop, held at [CHI 2016](http://chi2016.acm.org/wp/)
  * I've reviewed for [WJEC 2019](https://www.wjec.paris/)

  * Publicity Chair for [Cloud and Green Computing 2013](http://socialcloud.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/confs/CGC2013/)
  * Co-Organiser and Technical Program Committee for [Collective Social Awareness and Relevance workshop 2013](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/csar)

## Past Research

Prior to my fellowship, I was working on the [Recognition](http://www.recognition-project.eu/) project, an EU FP7 project attempting to use relevance and human cognitive processes within IT systems to improve content dissemination and filtering. The work included areas such as how human decision making processes relate to twitter and micro-blogging, and examining the relationship between spatial places/venues and people in terms of both their personality and the expression they use towards the places they've been.

Before the Recognition project, I spent a year and a half working on the [SocialNets](http://www.social-nets.eu/) project, another EU FP7 project concerning pervasive adaptation looking to improve mobile and ad-hoc systems using social network information and adaptive strategies.
