I am the Director of Learning and Teaching (DLT) for the School of Computer Science and Informatics. For the last few years I've been the Deputy DLT, and have spent a lot of time focused on Postgraduate students, working as the chair of the Postgraduate Operations Team, Senior Personal Tutor for Taught Postgraduate students, and the Student Rep Coordinator for the postgrad Student-Staff Panel.

I'm the MSc Programme Leader for the [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc), a joint course between the [School of Computer Science & Informatics](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/) and the [School of Journalism, Media and Culture](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture) here at Cardiff University.


## Autumn Semester



I am Module Leader for [Web Application Development (CMT112)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT112.html) in the Autumn semester. This module is core for the MSc Computing, MSc Computing and IT Management, and the MSc Computational and Data Journalism programmes, and is an optional module for students on the MSc Data Science and Analytics.



## Spring Semester



I am Module Leader for [Visual Communication and Information Design (CMT212)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT212.html), an optional module for several of the MSc programmes.

I also co-teach the [Digital Investigation (MCT542)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/MCT542.html) module on MSc Computational and Data Journalism.
