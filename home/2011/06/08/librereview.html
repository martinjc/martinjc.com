Libra</h1><p class=post__date>June 8, 2011</p><div class=post__content ?><p>Another of the very useful apps I’ve been using since the start of the “New Regime” is Libra. It totally makes up for the crappy progress graphs on the MyFitnessPal website or in the mobile app.</p><p>It’s an app that has a singular purpose: it’s just for tracking weight. But it does it very well. You enter a weight for every day, it works out statistics based on those weights, calculates the trend value for your weight, (so smoothes out daily fluctuations caused by water intake etc), and predicts when you’ll hit your target. It performs a weekly backup of data to the SD card, and will export data in csv format too.
