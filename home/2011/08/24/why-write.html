There aren’t going to be that many people reading, if any. Probably the only people that come past are going to be the other people in COMSC having a nose around to see what people are putting on their websites, and the few visitors I get from the random google searches that seem to appear in my analytics reports every now and again. Also probably my mum, because she’s a bit of an an internet stalker. Hi mum.</p><p>Despite the fact that no-one is reading, I think it’s important for me to write fairly regularly. It’s a good skill to practice and keep up, and I feel that even in these post-blog social network dominated days, the writing of a few lengthy blog posts on a particular topic every now and then is a fairly healthy habit to get into. The other reason to post regularly is the hope that when I post a bit of code that I’ve been working on, or an explanation of some work, someone somewhere will find it useful. So, I’ll continue to post, until I get bored.</p><p>With that in mind, recently I went back up to Edinburgh for a week for the festival. Because I have little work I feel like (or feel is ready for) writing about on here but still feel that writing semi-regularly is good for me, I’m going to post some reviews of my week up here. Almost a ‘what I did on my holidays’ type thing. So look forward to that over the next week or so.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
