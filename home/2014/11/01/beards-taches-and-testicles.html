It is patchy, it is more than often unkempt, and it is quite ginger, but it is somewhat beard like. I can no longer remember when I grew this beard, but I like it. I like it so much that I refused to shave it off when I graduated in 2013, and again when I got married earlier this year.</p><p>However, ominous things have happened. Recently, a mate and colleague done a tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524291166615789570</p><p>“Good on Pete” I thought. Good cause. I did Movember back in 2011, and it was hard, because quite frankly with a moustache I look like a complete tit. At the time I was doing it, I think Pete and I were sharing an office, so he knows how much of a tit you can look like during Movember, yet he’s chosen to do it anyway. Well done.</p><p>Of course, you won’t catch me doing it. I have a beard now, and I won’t shave that off. Also, as I mentioned, I look like a complete tit when I grow a moustache. It was fine in 2011, I was only an RA, so I could just hide in the office and work. The only person affected was my wife, who sadly had to be seen in public with me. I’m a lecturer now. I can’t just hide in my office. I have to teach. I have to stand up in front of students. I can’t do that looking like a person who belongs on some sort of list.</p><p>Then Vince Knight joined Pete’s team:</p><p>https://twitter.com/drvinceknight/status/524532773080805376</p><p>“Well done Vince” I thought. Good cause. At least Pete won’t look so daft walking around campus with a ‘tache now. There’ll be two of you at least. Not me of course. No way.</p><p>Then Pete done another tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/pbFeed/status/524533385847664640</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Pete’s called me out. He wants me to join in. Maybe we’ll just all ignore him and it’ll go away.</p><p>Then I done a tweet:</p><p>https://twitter.com/martinjc/status/524538880939544576</p><p>WTF? What did I just do? Did I agree to do Movember again? Why? I have no idea. Perhaps I enjoy looking like a tit?</p><p>So. I joined. As did many others that Pete called out. And now we’re all going to grow moustaches and demand money from our friends, relatives and colleagues. It’s a good cause. You can donate to us, our team page is <a href=http://uk.movember.com/team/1637929>here</a>.</p><p>First though, there’s business to take care of. The beard had to go. I had to locate my shaving equipment, which has not been used in many years, and attempt to remove the lovely facial hair to which I have become so attached, without slicing my face apart in the process:</p><p>[caption id=”attachment_1173” align=”aligncenter” width=”604”]<a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beard_removal.png><img src=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beard_removal-1024x910.png alt="WHAT HAVE I DONE?"></a>WHAT HAVE I DONE?[/caption]</p><p>So that’s it. The beard is off and I am clean-shaven for the first time in I don’t know how long. This, I think, is quite the sacrifice. But there is more to come. The ‘tache is on its way - slowly working its way out of my upper lip. I am going to look terrible. If you in any way feel inclined, please make it worth it. Donate to <a href=http://mobro.co/martinjc>me</a> or the <a href=http://moteam.co/cardiff-university>team</a>. Don’t let my beard have fallen in vain.  After all (I came up with this last night while very drunk and I LOVE IT):  beards grow back. Balls don’t.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
