Extraordinarily busy. Luckily, work is conspiring right along with me, with coding on our first experiment in full go-mode, a workshop + social dinner next week to help organise, reading and planning for our main ‘project’ to do, a paper to edit and revise for a workshop and a side project looking at 4sq to move from prototype ‘buggy as hell, falls over if you look at it funny’ mode to ‘production, solid as a rock, leave it running and forget about it’ mode. That’s all before you remember that there’s also the final deliverables to work on as well! Luckily it’s just what I need to keep my mind off the 20th.</p><p>Just hoping I can get it all done before I do actually need to stop and remember what it was I did for my PhD of course….</p></div></div></div></body></html>
