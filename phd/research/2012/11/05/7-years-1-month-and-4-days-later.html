A very, very, long time. As I’ve been waiting so long I’m going to start with the good news: on the 30th October 2012 I finally received confirmation that my examiners had accepted my PhD corrections and I should be approved for my degree. I’m Dr Martin Chorley.</p><p>Exactly how long I’ve been waiting to write this depends on your point of view. I’ve definitely been waiting eagerly for 1 month and 2 days, pretty certain that this day was coming. I’ve been waiting pretty expectantly for 3 months and 21 days, fairly sure that the day is coming soon. I’ve been <em>really desperate</em> to be able to write this for 1 year, 6 months and 10 days, unsure whether I’d ever be able to. But ultimately, I guess as it’s been exactly 7 years, 1 month and 4 days since I started my PhD, I’ve been waiting for this moment for at least that long (even though I wasn’t blogging back then, and certainly didn’t expect to be writing a bunch of posts like these!).</p><p>So, why did it take so long, and why was I waiting for so many different lengths of time? It’s a long story, so I’ll split it over several posts, but the basic facts are that I did badly, tried to fix it, didn’t fix it well enough, so had to fix it again. It’s finally done now, and I can move on with all the rest of the stuff I’ve got to do.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
