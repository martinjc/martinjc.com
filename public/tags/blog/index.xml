      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly sensible question: why do I write anything here? There aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be that many people reading, if any. Probably the only people that come past are going to be the other people in COMSC having a nose around to see what people are putting on their websites, and the few visitors I get from the random google searches that seem to appear in my analytics reports every now and again.</description>
