      <description>Finding myself with a free afternoon this week, I strolled down to the local Odeon to see Jurassic Park: IMAX 3D. (It should be noted that the &amp;lsquo;IMAX&amp;rdquo; bit doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much - the screen at the Odeon is nowhere near as big as a true &amp;lsquo;IMAX&amp;rsquo; screen). I should say, I love this film a lot - hence my willingness to pay £12 (£12!!??!) to see it again on the big screen.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the year I embarked upon a challenge: watch 100 movies in the cinema in 1 year. I thought it would be fun, but difficult.
It was fun.
It was difficult.
This is a not very brief account of that year, starting with the best movies that were released this year and that I saw in the cinema. In no particular order, I think the best movies released this year that I saw in the cinema were:</description>

      <description>After reading this blog post at the end of January I decided that watching at least 100 movies in the cinema in a year was the kind of challenge I could get behind. Last year&amp;rsquo;s challenge to get fit and healthy was fairly successful and seemed like much harder work than going to the cinema a few times could ever be. After all, 100 movies a year is less than 2 a week, so it must be easy, right?</description>
