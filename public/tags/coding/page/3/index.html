            <p>I&rsquo;m working on some notes for a beginners LaTeX course that I&rsquo;m giving for the University Graduate College this week. In a temporary fit of insanity I decided it would be nice to write all the slides in LaTeX, so that I can distribute the source to the students so they get some real world LaTeX examples to go along with the course notes.</p>

<p>I was attempting to make handouts for the students using the great <a href="http://www.guidodiepen.nl/2009/07/creating-latex-beamer-handouts-with-notes/">handoutWithNotes</a> package. However, as my slides are white, they looked a bit odd on a page without a frame around them:</p>

<p><img src="/img/{{ page.date | date: &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;}}-{{page.slug}}/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-09.40.18.png" alt="Slides without border" /></p>

<p>I wanted to add a border to make the handouts look better, but there were no suggestions at the <a href="http://www.guidodiepen.nl/2009/07/creating-latex-beamer-handouts-with-notes/">site I got the package from</a> as to how to add a frame, and I&rsquo;m too lazy to go digging in CTAN to see if there&rsquo;s any documentation.</p>

            <p>Today we are finally starting to promote our latest experiment. It&rsquo;s been online for about a month, but we haven&rsquo;t told anyone about it while we&rsquo;ve been finishing up the Year 2 deliverables for <a href="http://www.recognition-project.eu/">Recognition</a> (the review is in a couple of weeks - fingers crossed!) Now however I can start publicly talking about it and encouraging people to take part and get involved!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re calling it the Foursquare Personality Experiment, and it&rsquo;s available on the <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/">School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>&rsquo; website <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp">here</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp">http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically looking at comparing people&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCEAN_model_of_personality">five-factor OCEAN personality profiles</a> to the places that they check in to on <a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>. So, you go along to the site, sign in with your Foursquare account and take a really <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/bfi.htm">short 44-question personality test</a>. While you&rsquo;re doing that, we retrieve the list of places you&rsquo;ve been to from Foursquare. When it&rsquo;s all done, we show you your personality, and how it compares to the average personality of people in your area (average personality comes from the <a href="http://mypersonality.org/research/">mypersonality.org</a> data, thanks guys!). All the venues you&rsquo;ve checked into on Foursquare are simultaneously displayed on a map, and selecting one of them will show you the average personality profile for that venue. This allows you to compare yourself to all the other people who go to the same places as you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we get a bunch of (anonymised) personality profiles that are linked to venues, so we can see if there are any correlations between places/categories of places and personality profiles. For instance, one of the things we may find is that the average personality profiles of &ldquo;non-places&rdquo; (those places frequented by everybody: the supermarket, the train station etc.) are different from the average personality profiles of &ldquo;places&rdquo; (the places visited by a subset of people: independent coffee shops, your local pub etc). We may also expect people with different visiting patterns to have different personalities. For instance, maybe I mainly check-in to pubs and bars on Foursquare, while someone else mainly checks in to shops. Is there a difference between the personality profiles of people who check into more pubs and people who mainly check in to shops?</p>

<p>Obviously we&rsquo;ve only just started collecting data, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll start to see some answers to some of these questions soon.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again: <a href="http://swnfest.com/">SWN Festival</a> is once more upon us. It&rsquo;s the highlight of the musical year in Cardiff, and probably the one thing I&rsquo;ll miss about the city when (if?) I leave. In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty certain that even if I left the city I&rsquo;d make the pilgrimage back once a year for SWN because it&rsquo;s just too much fun to miss.</p>

<p>The lineup this year is another cracking one, but as usual with four days of bands spread across so many venues there are a whole bunch of names that I don&rsquo;t recognise. As per usual I&rsquo;ve cooked up a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/martinjc/playlist/4O56MWAi1qIO6XfCDXEtjG">Spotify playlist</a>, but even sorting through that takes some time:</p>

<p>I decided this year that it would be nice to have an easy visual way to see what the bands are like, so decided to build myself a little <a href="/swn/">artist explorer</a>. This uses tags from <a href="www.last.fm">Last.FM</a> and generates word clouds using a nice <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">javascript plugin</a> for <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a> written by <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/">Jason Davies</a>. Most of the word cloud js was hacked together from Jason&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/">example</a>, with some mangling and modification from me. I downloaded the tags for artists offline and stuck them in a .json file so it doesn&rsquo;t hit the Last.FM servers on every page load. What we end up with is a fairly simple tag cloud example that allows you to see at a glance how Last.FM users have categorised the bands. Selecting a tag in the word cloud will show you the other bands in the lineup that have also had that tag applied to them. Of course it&rsquo;s <a href="/swn">online here</a>!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/martinjc/swn_tagger">github</a>, with no guarantees that any of it actually works.</p>

            <p>Following a conversation with <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=J.A.Quinn">Jon</a> last week, I&rsquo;ve been having thoughts about playing around with Last.FM data again, having not looked at that <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/intro">API</a> for a couple of years. We had discussed the possibility of using the Last.FM web services as part of a project at a <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/hackathon/">hackathon</a> that some of the undergraduates are running in a couple of weeks time, and since I&rsquo;ve moved from primarily developing using Java to mainly using Python since I last did anything with Last.FM I thought it would be useful to develop some basic python examples using the Last.FM API.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a basic skeleton Django site that uses Last.FM for user authentication and includes a basic API wrapper for making queries. The code is all up on <a href="https://github.com/martinjc/djangoLastFMAuth">github</a> for those that are interested.</p>

            </p>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Yesterday I attended the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackday.boxuk.com/">For the Social Good</a>&rdquo; hackday, organised by <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">BoxUK</a> and held at the Students Union at Cardiff University. As you may have gathered from the title, it was a hackday themed around creating apps that had some benefit to society. The event ran from 10am to 10pm, so it was a fairly short hack event <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">compared to some</a>, which had a big influence on what could be done during the time available. In total, given the time needed for introductions and getting started in the morning, then for presentations and judging at the end of the day there was only actually about nine and a half hours of coding time, so it was quite a tough day. I went along with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voxmjw">Matt Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/whitehankey">Mark Greenwood</a> as our team and over the course of the day we managed to put together a fairly functional web app.</p>

<p>We took <a href="/2011/11/22/foursquare-hackathon-post-mortem/">what we learnt</a> from hosting and participating in the Foursquare hackathon and used that to guide what we did at this hackday. At the last event we had been slow to get going, took too long to form a team and decide upon an idea. We had aimed too high to begin with, and then also let feature creep affect what we wanted to build. Finally, our teams were far too big, meaning it was hard to divide labour up so that everyone was participating and had something to do. We finished with a working app at the end of the event, but we were determined not to make the same mistakes this time so we could get a more successful outcome. (Not that FourCrawl wasn&rsquo;t a successful outcome of course, but more on that in the next couple of weeks.)</p>

<p>Going in to this hackday we solved the team size problem naturally, as there were only three of us able to attend which made forming a small team compulsory! To try and get a good start on the day of the event we met together on the Wednesday before to have a think about ideas and a bit of a brainstorming session. While we had a lot of ideas, most of them were too complex for a short day long hack event, so unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t really come up with anything. We did have a vague idea of doing something related to cold weather though, to make whatever &lsquo;it&rsquo; was topical, given that we&rsquo;re heading into winter now. Fortunately at least one of us (not me) had obviously been thinking about it further after the meeting and on Saturday evening Matt sent round a message on G+ that he&rsquo;d found a good data set we could use for an app that would be both easy to code within the time limit, and would hit the brief for the hackday pretty well. He&rsquo;d found a dataset on <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> related to <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data">road accidents</a> that included information on weather and road surface conditions that we could use to show people where to avoid in icy weather, or to give them an idea of previous incidents in their area. With an idea starting to form we went into Sunday in a pretty good state, and ready to start coding very quickly.</p>

<p>The day started well, everyone arrived pretty much on time, which made for a quick start. Our app idea solidified easily, and early on we realised that while we had historical data to display it would also be nice to have some current updates, so we added a social element to the idea, by scraping twitter for a certain hashtag so that people could report problems with icy roads in their area, along the lines of the &lsquo;#uksnow&rsquo; hashtag that has been used frequently the last couple of winters. We were able to jump in quickly to start getting things built. Matt was in charge of getting the data into a database and building an api to query to retrieve it, using django to get a backend up and running quickly. I was in charge of building a front end map to display the data on, primarily working with HTML and javascript (and the Google Maps API obviously) and then Mark was in charge of getting the twitter scraping and postcode geo-locating working using python (so it could be slotted into the django backend), accessing the twitter API through <a href="http://tweepy.github.com/">tweepy</a>.</p>

<p>Things went really well with the implementation, I spent a while cannibalising elements from previous sites to get a frontend up and running quickly (and also thank you <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>!) and by lunch we were pretty close to starting to consolidate things together. We set a target of starting to deploy by 6, so that by the time dinner was served Matt was starting to battle his server and its stubborn refusal to allow easy deployment of django apps. Things went so smoothly in fact that we were all finished and ready with almost an hour to spare, meaning we were the only team able to slope off for a self-congratulatory pint before the presentations and judging. We headed to the Taf (a place I hadn&rsquo;t been in at least five years) for a swift one, then went back to the hackday for the final presentations.</p>

<p>Our presentation was first, and Matt demoed the app well while I played around on the laptop next to him. After us the rest of the teams went, and there were some really good apps shown off. My particular favourite was the &lsquo;<a href="http://occupywhere.herokuapp.com/">occupy where</a>&rsquo; app which allowed you to search for an &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; camp or demo near a location, then presented information pulled in from multiple sources about that particular &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; movement. A nice idea, well executed. Following the presentations the judges spent some time talking, then announced the winners. The surprise of the day was that they&rsquo;d decided our app was the best and that we&rsquo;d won! I was pretty shocked, but it was a very nice surprise. A group of first years from COMSC were runners up, and then a third year COMSC student (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/TomJHancocks">Tom Hancocks</a>) won the best individual developer prize, so COMSC actually walked away with all the prizes! After a quick tear down of the venue it was time to head to the Taf for some celebratory drinks, a satisfying end to a really great day.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I wrote this post just after the hackathon, but then forgot to actually publish it! </strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount I learnt from taking part in and helping to organise the <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">foursquare hackathon</a> here at the university that probably deserves its own post. I&rsquo;ll split it into two parts, the taking part and the organisation.</p>

<h2 id="organising-a-hack-event">Organising a hack event</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things I learnt from helping to organise the event that perhaps weren&rsquo;t clear to begin with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expect dropouts. A lot of them. We ended up with about 50% of the people that said they would attend actually attending. Which is fine because we hadn&rsquo;t planned on providing catering etc. anyway, but if we had, we may have overspent massively.</p></li>

<li><p>Get someone in to run the day that <em>doesn&rsquo;t actually want to code</em>. All three of us organising the event really wanted to get involved and create stuff, so there was no-one left to organise the other essential things like food. Too often people would talk about ordering food, or going out for dinner and then get sucked back into programming and it would get forgotten about. By the end of the weekend we&rsquo;d all eaten really badly, often very late at night. Having someone there to do things like order pizza or make coffee runs would probably have helped things go a lot smoother.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re going to be communicating with the world at large using twitter or something similar, make sure you communicate with each other within the organising team about posting updates. Often two people would try and reply to a query at the same time, which made us look a bit silly. Not a major issue, but it might help give a more professional feel, event if you&rsquo;re total amateurs.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="participating-in-a-hack-event">Participating in a hack event</h2>

<p>We also learnt a lot about participating in a hack event. My top tips for a successful project would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do your research. If you can, go into the event with an idea already, just in case no-one else has any. It&rsquo;ll help you get started quicker.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep it small. Don&rsquo;t over reach. <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> hours is not a long time to code something, and by making it too complicated you&rsquo;ll be disappointed with the outcome. Simple is best. Add extra features later if you have time.</p></li>

<li><p>Small, agile teams. These projects have to be small because of the time constraints, so if teams get too big there won&rsquo;t be enough for everyone to do. People will end up feeling useless or left out, which is never good. I would say a maximum of 4 people per team.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to learn something new, a hack event can be a great place to be forced to up your skills in a particular area very quickly. It can also be a great place to learn new skills and tools from others. However, this may lead to the end result not being ideal. If you can live with that, great, you&rsquo;ll walk away happy. I personally upped my javascript knowledge over the weekend from approximately 0 to something approaching a passable working knowledge, which was great.</p></li>

<li><p>Know your tools. This is pretty much common sense, but if you&rsquo;re not after learning something new and you just want a successful app/outcome, pick and use the tools you know really well. We went with django on the back end because myself and Matt know it pretty well, and we were able to get that part of the site running really really quickly. Had we gone with something else it may not have worked so well.</p></li>

<li><p>Get coding. Screw the design, you can worry about that later. Start coding early, and code fast.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So thats the things I learnt from the weekend. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to use this knowledge again in the future, both organising and participating in future events.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE [01 August 2014]: Even more breaking! More recent version of the script <a href="{{/2014/08/01/foursquare-icon-downloading-yet-again/">here</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 31/01/2011 - new version of the <a href="x/2012/01/31/foursquare-category-icon-downloader-2/">downloader</a> script is here</strong></p>

<p>A couple of projects I&rsquo;m working on at the moment need the ability to add foursquare venues to a map. This is pretty straightforward, but what is also needed is the ability to distinguish between the categories of the venues. To do this, I&rsquo;m adding custom markers to a google map at a venue location, with the marker having an icon representing the venue category.</p>

<p>Foursquare already have lots of category icons ready made, and they supply the urls in the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/explore.html#req=venues/categories">/venues/category</a> endpoint, which is handy.  It seems from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foursquare-api/TsRBGdXDgzg">official responses</a> on the forum that they don&rsquo;t mind you downloading these icons for use in your apps, and they also supply the icons in <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/foursquare-api/Pw0p4qqW79A/discussion">several sizes</a>, so hacking together a script to download all the available icons is pretty easy. The following python code will do just that - grab the latest category hierarchy from Foursquare, process it to extract all the category id&rsquo;s and icon locations, then download each icon in all available sizes:</p>

<p>After running this script, we have a local copy of all the category icons to use in our application downloaded. In my case, I need to be able to differentiate between venues within the categories, so it would be nice to have different coloured icons for my different classes of venue. Luckily this is also pretty simple. You&rsquo;ll need <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> installed, but if it is, the following code will go through all the greyscale icons downloaded with the previous script and convert them to whichever colours you like:</p>

<p>The colour names come from <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php">this list</a> of imagemagick colours, you can obviously pick whichever colours you want. If you run this script in the directory with the downloaded Foursquare category icons, you&rsquo;ll end up with a multitude of differently sized, differently coloured icons.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s that. Later I&rsquo;ll post about how to use these as custom markers in a google map.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3/10/11:</p>

<p>As this example stores icons by category id, it actually duplicates some of the icons, which is un-necessary. This version  stores the icons by icon name, so saving the downloading and processing of around 100 duplicate icons. It also splits the different sizes into different directories for better file management.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/10/11:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a change in the category json coming which will break this code. Use &ldquo;v=20111002&rdquo; as an extra parameter in the code that calls the Foursquare API and it&rsquo;ll keep working.</p>

            <p>Wow. I thought Saturday was busy, but I was wrong. Saturday was a cake walk compared to the crazy nightmare that was Sunday. The challenge of trying to get something (anything) working before the app submission deadline was incredible. Coding was fast and intense, and required a lot of good communication and fast thinking. Unfortunately we hit a few roadblocks that slowed us down (2 hours debugging problems with django&rsquo;s static file serving really didn&rsquo;t help, neither did jQuery mobile being an absolute pain in the rear end), but by the end of the day we had a nice looking site with some actual working functionality. Nowhere near the level of functionality that we&rsquo;d hoped for, but it&rsquo;s a start. All three of us that were working on the app towards the end are aiming to carry on the development, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll have another project to post about up here as the months go on.</p>

<p>A number of people didn&rsquo;t make it to the Sunday, which is a shame, but the core teams of both projects were in early and working hard, and by the end of the day both had been declared &lsquo;working&rsquo; enough to submit. Maybe they&rsquo;ll do ok against the competition, but we&rsquo;ll see. A couple more hours on our pub crawl app could really have helped as there&rsquo;s some key functionality missing, but there just wasn&rsquo;t time to get it working. Overall though, the event was a success. We managed to pull in people from outside our own hyper-local school development team, we all managed to learn some new things and teach some things to others, and I think most people genuinely had fun. It&rsquo;s definitely an experience I&rsquo;m looking forward to repeating, both as a hackday organiser and as just a participant. <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">BOX UK</a> have a &lsquo;<a href="http://hackday.boxuk.com/">For the Social Good</a>&rsquo; hackday coming up in November that I&rsquo;ve already registered for, and I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes open for others in the future, and for opportunities to organise more.</p>

<p>I think I learnt a few things about organising and participating in these sorts of events, so I&rsquo;ll be putting up a post in the next few days to share the knowledge.</p>
