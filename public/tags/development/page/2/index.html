            <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again: <a href="http://swnfest.com/">SWN Festival</a> is once more upon us. It&rsquo;s the highlight of the musical year in Cardiff, and probably the one thing I&rsquo;ll miss about the city when (if?) I leave. In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty certain that even if I left the city I&rsquo;d make the pilgrimage back once a year for SWN because it&rsquo;s just too much fun to miss.</p>

<p>The lineup this year is another cracking one, but as usual with four days of bands spread across so many venues there are a whole bunch of names that I don&rsquo;t recognise. As per usual I&rsquo;ve cooked up a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/martinjc/playlist/4O56MWAi1qIO6XfCDXEtjG">Spotify playlist</a>, but even sorting through that takes some time:</p>

<p>I decided this year that it would be nice to have an easy visual way to see what the bands are like, so decided to build myself a little <a href="/swn/">artist explorer</a>. This uses tags from <a href="www.last.fm">Last.FM</a> and generates word clouds using a nice <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">javascript plugin</a> for <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a> written by <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/">Jason Davies</a>. Most of the word cloud js was hacked together from Jason&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/">example</a>, with some mangling and modification from me. I downloaded the tags for artists offline and stuck them in a .json file so it doesn&rsquo;t hit the Last.FM servers on every page load. What we end up with is a fairly simple tag cloud example that allows you to see at a glance how Last.FM users have categorised the bands. Selecting a tag in the word cloud will show you the other bands in the lineup that have also had that tag applied to them. Of course it&rsquo;s <a href="/swn">online here</a>!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/martinjc/swn_tagger">github</a>, with no guarantees that any of it actually works.</p>

<p>Someone commented recently that the <a href="/2011/10/01/colourful-foursquare-category-icons/">script I&rsquo;d written to download the Foursquare category icons</a> was broken. <a href="/img/{{ page.date | date: &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;}}-{{page.slug}}/downloader.py_1.txt">downloader.py</a> is an update that works as of today (notice the URL param with today&rsquo;s date) that will fetch all available sizes of all the category icons and store them in folders by size.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I attended the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackday.boxuk.com/">For the Social Good</a>&rdquo; hackday, organised by <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">BoxUK</a> and held at the Students Union at Cardiff University. As you may have gathered from the title, it was a hackday themed around creating apps that had some benefit to society. The event ran from 10am to 10pm, so it was a fairly short hack event <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">compared to some</a>, which had a big influence on what could be done during the time available. In total, given the time needed for introductions and getting started in the morning, then for presentations and judging at the end of the day there was only actually about nine and a half hours of coding time, so it was quite a tough day. I went along with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voxmjw">Matt Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/whitehankey">Mark Greenwood</a> as our team and over the course of the day we managed to put together a fairly functional web app.</p>

<p>We took <a href="/2011/11/22/foursquare-hackathon-post-mortem/">what we learnt</a> from hosting and participating in the Foursquare hackathon and used that to guide what we did at this hackday. At the last event we had been slow to get going, took too long to form a team and decide upon an idea. We had aimed too high to begin with, and then also let feature creep affect what we wanted to build. Finally, our teams were far too big, meaning it was hard to divide labour up so that everyone was participating and had something to do. We finished with a working app at the end of the event, but we were determined not to make the same mistakes this time so we could get a more successful outcome. (Not that FourCrawl wasn&rsquo;t a successful outcome of course, but more on that in the next couple of weeks.)</p>

<p>Going in to this hackday we solved the team size problem naturally, as there were only three of us able to attend which made forming a small team compulsory! To try and get a good start on the day of the event we met together on the Wednesday before to have a think about ideas and a bit of a brainstorming session. While we had a lot of ideas, most of them were too complex for a short day long hack event, so unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t really come up with anything. We did have a vague idea of doing something related to cold weather though, to make whatever &lsquo;it&rsquo; was topical, given that we&rsquo;re heading into winter now. Fortunately at least one of us (not me) had obviously been thinking about it further after the meeting and on Saturday evening Matt sent round a message on G+ that he&rsquo;d found a good data set we could use for an app that would be both easy to code within the time limit, and would hit the brief for the hackday pretty well. He&rsquo;d found a dataset on <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> related to <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data">road accidents</a> that included information on weather and road surface conditions that we could use to show people where to avoid in icy weather, or to give them an idea of previous incidents in their area. With an idea starting to form we went into Sunday in a pretty good state, and ready to start coding very quickly.</p>

<p>The day started well, everyone arrived pretty much on time, which made for a quick start. Our app idea solidified easily, and early on we realised that while we had historical data to display it would also be nice to have some current updates, so we added a social element to the idea, by scraping twitter for a certain hashtag so that people could report problems with icy roads in their area, along the lines of the &lsquo;#uksnow&rsquo; hashtag that has been used frequently the last couple of winters. We were able to jump in quickly to start getting things built. Matt was in charge of getting the data into a database and building an api to query to retrieve it, using django to get a backend up and running quickly. I was in charge of building a front end map to display the data on, primarily working with HTML and javascript (and the Google Maps API obviously) and then Mark was in charge of getting the twitter scraping and postcode geo-locating working using python (so it could be slotted into the django backend), accessing the twitter API through <a href="http://tweepy.github.com/">tweepy</a>.</p>

<p>Things went really well with the implementation, I spent a while cannibalising elements from previous sites to get a frontend up and running quickly (and also thank you <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>!) and by lunch we were pretty close to starting to consolidate things together. We set a target of starting to deploy by 6, so that by the time dinner was served Matt was starting to battle his server and its stubborn refusal to allow easy deployment of django apps. Things went so smoothly in fact that we were all finished and ready with almost an hour to spare, meaning we were the only team able to slope off for a self-congratulatory pint before the presentations and judging. We headed to the Taf (a place I hadn&rsquo;t been in at least five years) for a swift one, then went back to the hackday for the final presentations.</p>

<p>Our presentation was first, and Matt demoed the app well while I played around on the laptop next to him. After us the rest of the teams went, and there were some really good apps shown off. My particular favourite was the &lsquo;<a href="http://occupywhere.herokuapp.com/">occupy where</a>&rsquo; app which allowed you to search for an &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; camp or demo near a location, then presented information pulled in from multiple sources about that particular &lsquo;occupy&rsquo; movement. A nice idea, well executed. Following the presentations the judges spent some time talking, then announced the winners. The surprise of the day was that they&rsquo;d decided our app was the best and that we&rsquo;d won! I was pretty shocked, but it was a very nice surprise. A group of first years from COMSC were runners up, and then a third year COMSC student (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/TomJHancocks">Tom Hancocks</a>) won the best individual developer prize, so COMSC actually walked away with all the prizes! After a quick tear down of the venue it was time to head to the Taf for some celebratory drinks, a satisfying end to a really great day.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I wrote this post just after the hackathon, but then forgot to actually publish it! </strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount I learnt from taking part in and helping to organise the <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">foursquare hackathon</a> here at the university that probably deserves its own post. I&rsquo;ll split it into two parts, the taking part and the organisation.</p>

<h2 id="organising-a-hack-event">Organising a hack event</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things I learnt from helping to organise the event that perhaps weren&rsquo;t clear to begin with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expect dropouts. A lot of them. We ended up with about 50% of the people that said they would attend actually attending. Which is fine because we hadn&rsquo;t planned on providing catering etc. anyway, but if we had, we may have overspent massively.</p></li>

<li><p>Get someone in to run the day that <em>doesn&rsquo;t actually want to code</em>. All three of us organising the event really wanted to get involved and create stuff, so there was no-one left to organise the other essential things like food. Too often people would talk about ordering food, or going out for dinner and then get sucked back into programming and it would get forgotten about. By the end of the weekend we&rsquo;d all eaten really badly, often very late at night. Having someone there to do things like order pizza or make coffee runs would probably have helped things go a lot smoother.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re going to be communicating with the world at large using twitter or something similar, make sure you communicate with each other within the organising team about posting updates. Often two people would try and reply to a query at the same time, which made us look a bit silly. Not a major issue, but it might help give a more professional feel, event if you&rsquo;re total amateurs.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="participating-in-a-hack-event">Participating in a hack event</h2>

<p>We also learnt a lot about participating in a hack event. My top tips for a successful project would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do your research. If you can, go into the event with an idea already, just in case no-one else has any. It&rsquo;ll help you get started quicker.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep it small. Don&rsquo;t over reach. <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> hours is not a long time to code something, and by making it too complicated you&rsquo;ll be disappointed with the outcome. Simple is best. Add extra features later if you have time.</p></li>

<li><p>Small, agile teams. These projects have to be small because of the time constraints, so if teams get too big there won&rsquo;t be enough for everyone to do. People will end up feeling useless or left out, which is never good. I would say a maximum of 4 people per team.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to learn something new, a hack event can be a great place to be forced to up your skills in a particular area very quickly. It can also be a great place to learn new skills and tools from others. However, this may lead to the end result not being ideal. If you can live with that, great, you&rsquo;ll walk away happy. I personally upped my javascript knowledge over the weekend from approximately 0 to something approaching a passable working knowledge, which was great.</p></li>

<li><p>Know your tools. This is pretty much common sense, but if you&rsquo;re not after learning something new and you just want a successful app/outcome, pick and use the tools you know really well. We went with django on the back end because myself and Matt know it pretty well, and we were able to get that part of the site running really really quickly. Had we gone with something else it may not have worked so well.</p></li>

<li><p>Get coding. Screw the design, you can worry about that later. Start coding early, and code fast.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So thats the things I learnt from the weekend. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to use this knowledge again in the future, both organising and participating in future events.</p>

            <p>I figure it&rsquo;s about time I posted an update on the <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/research/augmented-conversation/">summer project</a> that myself and Ian are supervising. Our summer student Nick is now two weeks into the project and seems to be getting to grips nicely with the problem. He also seems to be coping pretty well with two novice supervisors babbling away at him whenever we meet up! If he leaves the office without being completely overwhelmed with information I think it&rsquo;s been a successful meeting.</p>

<p>So far Nick has managed to code some software that takes textual input, passes it to several web services for keyword detection and then performs searches for relevant content on Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The next stage is to get to grips with the temporal nature of conversations so that the keyword detection and searches are carried out continually, with some control of time scales and how much text is used as input. After that we&rsquo;ll start to look at algorithms for combining keywords to get the most successful search queries possible. Meanwhile, we need to come up with a human evaluation that isn&rsquo;t going to make everyone at MobiSoc hate us when we ask them to do it, and an algorithmic evaluation that makes sense and actually evaluates the right parts of the system.</p>

<p>Overall though we&rsquo;re ahead of schedule, which is a very good place to be. I&rsquo;ll continue to post about progress as the project goes on.</p>

            <p>There is a lot of information out there that talks about putting Django and Tweepy together to make a Twitter web app. I read a lot of it recently, and although a lot of it is helpful some of it can be quite complicated or out of date.</p>

<p>To make things simple, I thought I&rsquo;d create an example Django project that just contains the basics needed to get up and running.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;DjangoTweepy&rsquo; project, hosted on <a href="https://github.com/martinjc/DjangoTweepy">Github here</a> contains all the code needed to get up and running with a Twitter web app using Django and Tweepy. Download it and follow the instructions to get up and running quickly, or with a bit of hacking add the &lsquo;twitter_auth&rsquo; app to your existing projects.</p>

            <p>Next week we have the project partners coming over to Cardiff for a workshop. Stu and myself were discussing that we should have some way to display information throughout the day, something that makes it easy to pick out the main themes of talks etc. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> as a way of displaying text, so we thought it would be nice if we could have a dynamic Wordle displayed that people could add to throughout the workshop.</p>

<p>I found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/atizo/PyTagCloud">pyTagCloud</a> that will turn text into wordle-like tag clouds either as images or as html. As I <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/2011/03/28/fun-with-django/">mentioned previously</a> I already have a django based project on the go which interfaces with twitter, so I already had code written that uses <a href="https://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy">Tweepy</a> to OAuth with twitter and do a search for keywords. Combining the two, I get an app that will continually search twitter for a given keyword, extract the text from all the tweets and display a wordle along with the latest tweets. People can contribute to the display by tweeting with a given hash tag, and as long as we search for that hash tag, their opinions and notes will be displayed.</p>

<p>For instance, here&rsquo;s the display running with one of today&rsquo;s trending topics: &lsquo;Alan Titchmarsh&rsquo;:</p>










<figure>
    <img src="/2011/04/04/twitter-wordle/tweets12-300x182.png" width="300" height="182" alt="">
    <figcaption>
        <small>
            
        </small>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely perfect, I need to do some more filtering on the text to remove some words that aren&rsquo;t removed by the stop word filtering that pyTagCloud does such as &lsquo;rt&rsquo;, &lsquo;http&rsquo;, &lsquo;bit&rsquo;, &lsquo;ly&rsquo; and so on. It would also be good to remove things that aren&rsquo;t words, like &lsquo;xxxxxx&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve been looking at the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a> for a couple of days for the other project, so I&rsquo;ll probably re-use some of that code here too.</p>

<p>The only problem now is that I&rsquo;m probably going to be the only person at the workshop tweeting&hellip;</p>

            <p>One of the latest ideas we are working on for the new project is looking at how providing different amounts of information affects our perception of content.  Even in pure implementation terms this is interestingly unlike any of the work I&rsquo;ve done in the last few years, most of which was simulation based. &ldquo;<em>Code a simulation, run the simulation, analyse the results</em>&rdquo; has been a pattern of work since the beginning of my PhD and beyond. This recent idea however needs us to essentially survey a large number of people, so rather than just coding some command-line simulation in C/C++ (or god-forbid, Fortran) that only one or two people might use, I&rsquo;m building a web based system that (hopefully) will have many hundreds of people interact with it.</p>

<p>From the fact that this website is just a basic wordpress install with very few changes to the default theme you can probably tell that I am not a web developer. In the recent past I&rsquo;ve very rarely had any call to do anything web-based beyond just keeping a personal (static HTML + CSS) home page up to date here at the school. To suddenly move into building a dynamic website that does a lot of complicated database stuff and interfaces with other services via OAuth is quite a jump. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s been a relatively easy jump thanks to <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to ramble on about what django is (basically a python web framework), if you haven&rsquo;t heard of it go check it out. What I am going to do is recommend it highly. It is so simple, so quick and so powerful that implementing a web project with it is dreamy. We first discussed this research idea sometime at the beginning of the month, and I started coding it sometime around the 16th. Since then I&rsquo;ve actually spent a week working on another project (and the ever present SocialNets deliverables for the EU), but I&rsquo;m still massively into implementation to the point where I&rsquo;m confident of having a site ready to beta test this week. Which I think is pretty good going for someone with as little web programming skill as I have!</p>

<p>So, there. Django. Try it out, it&rsquo;s aces.</p>

<p>p.s - the project will hopefully be open to the public at some point in the future, once it is, I&rsquo;ll post here.</p>
