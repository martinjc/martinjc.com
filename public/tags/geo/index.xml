      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just put an archive online containing GeoJSON and topoJSON for UK boundary data. It&amp;rsquo;s all stored on Github, with a viewer and download site hosted on Github pages.
   Browser for the UK topoJSON stored in the Github repository    The data is all created from shapefiles released by the Office of National Statistics, Ordnance Survey and National Records Scotland, all under the Open Government and OS OpenData licences.</description>

      <description>As I was eating lunch this afternoon, I spotted a conversation between @JoeReddington and @MySociety whizz past in Tweetdeck. I traced the conversation back to the beginning and found this request for data:
I&amp;#39;m looking for a dataset that shows which UK constituencies are in which NHS trust areas. Anyone?

I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of playing with geographic data recently whileÂ preparing to release a site making it easier to get GeoJSON boundaries of various areas in the UK.</description>
