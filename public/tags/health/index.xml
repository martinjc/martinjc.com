      <description>Interesting news this morning that MyFitnessPal has been bought by Under Armour for $475 million. I&amp;rsquo;ve used MFP for many years now, and it was pretty helpful in helping me lose all the excess PhD weight that I&amp;rsquo;d put on, and then maintaining a healthy(ish) lifestyle since 2010.
News of an acquisition always has me slightly worried though - not for someone else having access to my data, as I&amp;rsquo;ve made my peace with the fact that using a free service generally means that it&amp;rsquo;s me that&amp;rsquo;s being sold.</description>
