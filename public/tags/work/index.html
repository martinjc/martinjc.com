            <p>So. 2013. That was an alright year. Finished the Recognition project, finally graduated, got a 12 month fellowship, started some interesting projects, and pushed on with the new MSc with JOMEC. Professionally, not too bad at all. Personally the year wasn&rsquo;t bad either, what with getting engaged and finally getting the house on the market.</p>

<p>But now it&rsquo;s a new year, so it&rsquo;s time to push things on further. My plans so far for this year seem to be &lsquo;smash it&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s papers to be published, data to be analysed and project proposals to write (and get funded!). Getting a permanent job would be quite nice, while I&rsquo;m at it. Here&rsquo;s to 2014 being even more successful than last year.</p>

            <p>This week, as part of the &ldquo;<a href="http://socialcloud.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/confs/SCA2013/">Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications</a>&rdquo; we held a workshop &ldquo;<a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/csar/">Collective Social Awareness and Relevance (CSAR)</a>&rdquo;. Organising the workshop (along with Walter Colombo) over the last couple of months has been an interesting process - this is the first time I&rsquo;ve had the chance to get involved in &ldquo;real&rdquo; workshop organisation, so this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen the process up close. It&rsquo;s a very involved process: from deciding upon and inviting Program Committee members, publicising the workshop, soliciting submissions, and navigating through the review process and getting a set of accepted papers it&rsquo;s been a fair challenge. Really it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without Walter doing such a good job of pushing the PC members to get their reviews done, he really drove that whole process, so I could sit back a bit there.</p>

<p>We ended up with 3 good papers accepted, which were presented in a session yesterday morning. The talks were informative and useful, and generated a good number of questions and discussion, which is really all you can hope for. It was also my first time chairing a session at a conference, which was fairly daunting, but turned out to be fairly easy and interesting. It was nice to be the one asking the difficult questions at the end of the presentation, rather than being on the receiving end.</p>

<p>Overall the workshop went very well. I wasn&rsquo;t sure beforehand whether we&rsquo;d try and run it again, but actually now I think it would be a shame not to. I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes out for a conference that we can latch onto sometime next year.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m really very pleased to be able to say that I have been awarded a 2013 EPSRC doctoral award fellowship. This means I&rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to spend 12 months from October this year working independently on a research project of my own choosing. I&rsquo;ll be looking at the connection between places and personality, analysing the large dataset collected through the <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp/">Foursquare Personality</a> app to try and build towards a recommendation system for places that uses personality as one of its key input signals.</p>

<p>I think this is a really interesting research project, and I&rsquo;m hoping for some good results. The basic question I&rsquo;m asking is: if we know where someone has been (i.e. from their Foursquare history) then can we predict what their personality is? If we can do that, then maybe we can do the reverse, and from someone&rsquo;s personality, infer where they might like to go. This could lead to a shift in the way that place recommendation systems are built, utilising not just the knowledge of <em>where</em> someone has been, but also <em>why</em> someone has been there.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity -  while it has been really good to work on the last two EU projects I&rsquo;ve been involved in, the overheads (especially the deliverables) have sometimes been a distraction and have sometimes gotten in the way of the research. With this project I&rsquo;ll be able to plough on with the research without having to worry about those kinds of administrative overheads. It&rsquo;s also a great stepping stone on my academic career path, and should give me the opportunity to generate some high quality outputs that will help with moving on to the next stage.</p>

            <p>We are storming along with <a href="/research/student-projects/">summer projects</a> now, and starting to see some really good results.</p>

<p>Liam Turner (who is starting a PhD in the school in October) has been working hard to create a mobile version of the <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp/">4SQPersonality</a> app. His work is coming along really well, with a great mobile HTML version now up and running, a native android wrapper working, and an iOS wrapper on its way. With any luck we&rsquo;ll have mobile apps for both major platforms ready to be released before the summer is over.</p>

<p>Max Chandler, who is now a second year undergraduate, has done some great work looking at the Foursquare venues within various cities around the UK, analysing them for similarity and spatial distribution. He&rsquo;s just over halfway through the project now and is beginning to work on visualising the data he&rsquo;s collected and analysed. He&rsquo;s creating some interesting interactive visualisations using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>, so as soon as he&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ll link to the website here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a really good summer for student projects so far, with some really pleasing results. I&rsquo;ll post more description of the projects and share some of the results as they come to a close in the coming weeks.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I&rsquo;ve very recently had the opportunity to be involved in a different kind of lecture here at the School of Computer Science and Informatics. For his final year project one of our third year students (Samuel Boyes) is assessing the use of modern technology, social networking and video conferencing as part of the traditional lecture. As I had already been asked a few weeks ago to give a guest lecture in <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/staffpage.php?emailname=M.J.Williams">Matt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/voxmjw">Williams</a>&rsquo; module <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/currentstudents/bsccompsci/">Fundamentals of Computing with Java</a>, on the topic of code maintainability/readability, we were presented with a nice opportunity to test out Sam&rsquo;s theories in an actual lecture.</p>

<p>So, rather than giving a dull, fifty-minutes-of-me-waffling-on-about-things-at-the-front-of-a-lecture-theatre lecture, we changed things around. Instead, I spoke for twenty minutes on the general theory aspects of the topic, and following that we were joined in the lecture by an external speaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/HandyBiteSize">Carey</a> <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/careyhiles">Hiles</a> of <a href="http://www.boxuk.com/">Box UK</a>, who joined via a Google+ Hangout to deliver some material about his experiences of the topic in the real world. The students were encouraged to get involved during the lecture, tweeting with a particular hashtag and leaving messages in a dedicated facebook group. We could then wrap the session up by going over the questions posted by the students, putting them to Carey through the video conferencing.</p>

<p>This was very interesting, as it allowed us to include the experiences and knowledge of someone out in the real world within the lecture, adding some extra value to the course and introducing students to ideas that are used in practice. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that we should be doing more of, and that I&rsquo;d love to include in more lectures in the future. There are people out there with relevant real world experience and a desire to talk to students and improve the quality of education. Given the availability of tools that allow people to get involved in lectures remotely, it seems like a no-brainer that this kind of thing could and should happen more often.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also directly relevant as there seems to be a strong desire to increase the added value of attending lectures and to improve the quality of teaching. The Higher Education sector in the UK is undergoing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/12/higher-education-policy-blue-skies">something of a transformation</a> at the moment. Massive unjustified increases in tuition fees have fundamentally altered the relationship between universities and students, increasing the feeling that students are customers of the the institution. As such, students are now (rightly) <a href="http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/uploads/Staying-on-Top-The-challenge-of-sustaining-world-class-higher-education-in-the-UK.pdf">demanding much better customer service and value for money from their institution</a> (caution: PDF link!). (We&rsquo;ll leave aside for now how the the universities are having to increase the value for money and customer service without actually having any more money, as that&rsquo;s another argument.)</p>

<p>Seen in a global context, this customer-institution relationship becomes even more important. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">Massive online open course</a> (MOOC) providers such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and the UK based <a href="http://futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> (in which my employer, <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a>, is involved) are providing large numbers of people with free educational material and courses. It&rsquo;s still not clear how universities will end up continuing to make money from teaching while also giving away all their material for free. Some MOOC providers will charge other institutions licensing fees to use materials, while it seems fairly plausible that instead of charging to access material, universities will instead start to charge for providing credentials and certification once the courses have been completed.</p>

<p>If that really is a large part of the future of higher education, will the traditional lecture continue to exist? Will universities need lecture theatres full of hundreds of students, when they can put their material online and deliver teaching to thousands of students without the physical presence? Will the traditional university institution continue to exist? It&rsquo;s entirely possible that many institutions could stop teaching and focus purely on research. It&rsquo;s more than possible that some institutions will close entirely in the face of competition of &lsquo;free&rsquo; teaching from higher ranked institutions. Is consolidation of teaching delivery between fewer larger institutions a good thing?</p>

<p>Until we discover the answers to these questions over the next few years (decades?), there&rsquo;s still a need to ensure that students feel they are getting value for money. We need to ensure that the institution continues to provide a reason for students to pay to attend lectures where material is delivered that could instead be had online for free. Value added is more important than ever and maybe sessions like the one we had last week could play a part in that.</p>

            <p>Today we are finally starting to promote our latest experiment. It&rsquo;s been online for about a month, but we haven&rsquo;t told anyone about it while we&rsquo;ve been finishing up the Year 2 deliverables for <a href="http://www.recognition-project.eu/">Recognition</a> (the review is in a couple of weeks - fingers crossed!) Now however I can start publicly talking about it and encouraging people to take part and get involved!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re calling it the Foursquare Personality Experiment, and it&rsquo;s available on the <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/">School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a>&rsquo; website <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp">here</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp">http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/recognition/foursqexp</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically looking at comparing people&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCEAN_model_of_personality">five-factor OCEAN personality profiles</a> to the places that they check in to on <a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>. So, you go along to the site, sign in with your Foursquare account and take a really <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~johnlab/bfi.htm">short 44-question personality test</a>. While you&rsquo;re doing that, we retrieve the list of places you&rsquo;ve been to from Foursquare. When it&rsquo;s all done, we show you your personality, and how it compares to the average personality of people in your area (average personality comes from the <a href="http://mypersonality.org/research/">mypersonality.org</a> data, thanks guys!). All the venues you&rsquo;ve checked into on Foursquare are simultaneously displayed on a map, and selecting one of them will show you the average personality profile for that venue. This allows you to compare yourself to all the other people who go to the same places as you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we get a bunch of (anonymised) personality profiles that are linked to venues, so we can see if there are any correlations between places/categories of places and personality profiles. For instance, one of the things we may find is that the average personality profiles of &ldquo;non-places&rdquo; (those places frequented by everybody: the supermarket, the train station etc.) are different from the average personality profiles of &ldquo;places&rdquo; (the places visited by a subset of people: independent coffee shops, your local pub etc). We may also expect people with different visiting patterns to have different personalities. For instance, maybe I mainly check-in to pubs and bars on Foursquare, while someone else mainly checks in to shops. Is there a difference between the personality profiles of people who check into more pubs and people who mainly check in to shops?</p>

<p>Obviously we&rsquo;ve only just started collecting data, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll start to see some answers to some of these questions soon.</p>

                    PhD Post-mortem - The Summary

            <p class="author">
                <span class="date">Friday, Nov 16, 2012</span>
            </p>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I originally wrote a whole bunch of posts (6!) about my PhD, what went wrong, how I felt about it,  and so on. Then I read it all back and it was a bunch of hugely self-indulgent poorly written bollocks (what&rsquo;s new?), so I decided not to publish it. Maybe sometime later I&rsquo;ll get round to it, but for now, the tl-dr; is:</p>

<p><strong>My viva was a car crash, my examiners hated my work, I got too depressed over the result to engage with the corrections process, had another viva, it was terrible but not as bad, I pulled it together and corrected it all in the end, thanks to some excellent support from everyone else.</strong></p>

<p>This summary that I&rsquo;d also written might be useful to others in the same or similar position however, so I figure it&rsquo;s worth putting online.</p>

<p>So, what have we learned from the car crash that was my PhD?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you pick the right examiners. </strong>My examiners were heavy-weight examiners, both of whom had a very similar statistical view on things. Let&rsquo;s get it straight up front: they were right about my thesis in the first viva. It was definitely poor to average, and now it&rsquo;s good. But other examiners would probably have passed it first time, or at least not have been quite as negative about the whole situation. The fact that they were both external and both didn&rsquo;t like it basically caused a negative feedback loop, which ended very badly for me.
I originally thought that had my supervisor chosen better, I would have passed earlier and that would have been good. But actually, having harsh examiners has done me a favour. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve survived this entire process intact, going from crushing disappointment to ultimate success and that&rsquo;s made me a much stronger person. But also, as I&rsquo;ve said, they were right about my thesis. My thesis is far better now than it was when it was first submitted, and is something I can now be rightly proud of. It stood up to harsher scrutiny than most theses are subjected to, and came out well in the end.
Had you asked me 16 months ago whether we&rsquo;d picked the right examiners, I would have said &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Ask me now, and I&rsquo;d probably still say &lsquo;No&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;d take one of them. A harsher scrutiny leads to a better thesis.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Progress monitoring does not work. </strong>I passed every single yearly review during my PhD. I attended and participated in every single poster session and research retreat during my PhD (when I wasn&rsquo;t up in Edinburgh). I even won best presentation on two separate occasions. At no point did anyone in the school pick up on the problems that my examiners felt were major enough to prevent me passing. Not one member of my yearly review panel. Not my supervisor. Not any of the audience or staff members I talked to during progress review events. In my case, progress monitoring was useless. Yes, it will catch those people who are failing anyway and clearly haven&rsquo;t done enough work, but my case, the case of the person who is doing the work but has just missed something, can slip through the cracks.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Get a second opinion. </strong>Would another set of eyes reading my thesis have caught the problems? Possibly. I lost contact with my second supervisor after a couple of years (one of the perils of having a supervisor in a different academic school when the cross-discipline project you&rsquo;re working on falls apart). Had I had another, maybe they would have caught some of the more minor things which the examiners caught. Fewer minor errors or problems may have decreased some of the negativity of the examiners.
Interestingly, I did get a couple of friends to read it (just proof reading for typo&rsquo;s etc) and one of them did make a point that was similar to the examiners major problem with the work. If only I&rsquo;d listened&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>A bad viva outcome is not the end of the world. </strong>It&rsquo;s devastating, but you can get through it. And basically, the easiest way to do it is to do the exact opposite of what I did. Engage with your examiners. Get them to clarify corrections. Send them drafts of things. Communicate with them. Ultimately, they don&rsquo;t want to fail you, it causes too much paperwork.
Had I done this, I would have been done far sooner. Ultimately in total I spent about a month and a half working full-time to correct everything, from after the first viva to final acceptance. Had I engaged with the examiners that would have been a month&rsquo;s full-time work. I could have proven them wrong, shown them their decision was wrong, but I ignored it, ran away, and caused myself more problems than I needed to.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s totally worth it. </strong>My thesis is now safe in the university digital repository, and I&rsquo;ll get my PhD rubber stamped at the next awards committee. That is amazing. When I got the email about having passed, I was leaving work for a run. I ran down to the bay, out onto the barrage to meet Lisa from work, and sat staring out at the sea. It was over at long last. I worked harder for it, and I suffered more to get there, and that makes it all the sweeter.</p></li>

            <p>As someone who spends most of their life elbow deep in research, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to take a step back and view what you&rsquo;re doing from the outside.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my ability to communicate our work to a scientific audience. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been trained (and have trained myself) to do over the last five or six years and so is something I find quite easy. The thought of having to explain what I do to a conference audience, or to the project partners in a meeting is something that I know I can cope with.</p>

<p>Explaining it to a general audience however is a different prospect. As part of some scheme or other there was a researcher from the BBC visiting the school today to see what we get up to. She stopped by our lab/office for ten minutes and I had to explain what it is we do in general terms. Explaining something like the mobility work that we&rsquo;ve done is slightly tricky without having to get into details about the whys and hows of opportunistic/ad-hoc networking and mobility models. It&rsquo;s especially tricky when you haven&rsquo;t thought about what you&rsquo;re going to say at all. Fortunately the more recent work we&rsquo;ve been doing focusing on human decision making with regards to twitter is much easier, as is the personality/foursquare work that&rsquo;s currently in the final stages of implementation. This work is easy to understand because it&rsquo;s all about what people do and why they do it - I think a general audience can understand it easily because they have some form of empathy with the experiment participants. But communicating this work still forces you to step outside of the research and look back to see what is interesting not just to you as a researcher in the field, but to the public at large.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re fortunate in the little corner of computer science in which I work as ultimately the closer you get to humans, the more interesting the work is to a general audience, and so the easier it is to talk about and present.</p>

            <p>Both of the summer projects that I&rsquo;m supervising with Walter Colombo have now started, with two students joining us for 8 weeks over summer to gain some experience of the research environment and work on some (hopefully) interesting projects.</p>

<p>One of our students (James) is investigating the ranking of content on Twitter by pairwise comparison. He&rsquo;s currently building a website to allow comparison of tweets and hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to get enough people to have a go at it that we can gather a large number of ratings of tweets. From there we can investigate different ranking systems and do some analysis to see if we can pull out what makes a tweet &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. The site should go live soon, so watch this space for an announcement.</p>

<p>The other student (Tim) has just started yesterday and is going to be analysing retweet propagation through the Twitter social network. Hopefully this will tie into some work being done by Will (a PhD student in the school). As he&rsquo;s only just started we have no firm plans yet, but we&rsquo;ll maybe end up looking at some community detection or some other type of analysis to go along with this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try and post regularly on these and keep the project pages updated throughout the summer.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I wrote this post just after the hackathon, but then forgot to actually publish it! </strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount I learnt from taking part in and helping to organise the <a href="/2011/09/14/foursquare-hackathon/">foursquare hackathon</a> here at the university that probably deserves its own post. I&rsquo;ll split it into two parts, the taking part and the organisation.</p>

<h2 id="organising-a-hack-event">Organising a hack event</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things I learnt from helping to organise the event that perhaps weren&rsquo;t clear to begin with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expect dropouts. A lot of them. We ended up with about 50% of the people that said they would attend actually attending. Which is fine because we hadn&rsquo;t planned on providing catering etc. anyway, but if we had, we may have overspent massively.</p></li>

<li><p>Get someone in to run the day that <em>doesn&rsquo;t actually want to code</em>. All three of us organising the event really wanted to get involved and create stuff, so there was no-one left to organise the other essential things like food. Too often people would talk about ordering food, or going out for dinner and then get sucked back into programming and it would get forgotten about. By the end of the weekend we&rsquo;d all eaten really badly, often very late at night. Having someone there to do things like order pizza or make coffee runs would probably have helped things go a lot smoother.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re going to be communicating with the world at large using twitter or something similar, make sure you communicate with each other within the organising team about posting updates. Often two people would try and reply to a query at the same time, which made us look a bit silly. Not a major issue, but it might help give a more professional feel, event if you&rsquo;re total amateurs.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="participating-in-a-hack-event">Participating in a hack event</h2>

<p>We also learnt a lot about participating in a hack event. My top tips for a successful project would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do your research. If you can, go into the event with an idea already, just in case no-one else has any. It&rsquo;ll help you get started quicker.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep it small. Don&rsquo;t over reach. <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> hours is not a long time to code something, and by making it too complicated you&rsquo;ll be disappointed with the outcome. Simple is best. Add extra features later if you have time.</p></li>

<li><p>Small, agile teams. These projects have to be small because of the time constraints, so if teams get too big there won&rsquo;t be enough for everyone to do. People will end up feeling useless or left out, which is never good. I would say a maximum of 4 people per team.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to learn something new, a hack event can be a great place to be forced to up your skills in a particular area very quickly. It can also be a great place to learn new skills and tools from others. However, this may lead to the end result not being ideal. If you can live with that, great, you&rsquo;ll walk away happy. I personally upped my javascript knowledge over the weekend from approximately 0 to something approaching a passable working knowledge, which was great.</p></li>

<li><p>Know your tools. This is pretty much common sense, but if you&rsquo;re not after learning something new and you just want a successful app/outcome, pick and use the tools you know really well. We went with django on the back end because myself and Matt know it pretty well, and we were able to get that part of the site running really really quickly. Had we gone with something else it may not have worked so well.</p></li>

<li><p>Get coding. Screw the design, you can worry about that later. Start coding early, and code fast.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So thats the things I learnt from the weekend. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to use this knowledge again in the future, both organising and participating in future events.</p>
