      <description>So. 2013. That was an alright year. Finished the Recognition project, finally graduated, got a 12 month fellowship, started some interesting projects, and pushed on with the new MSc with JOMEC. Professionally, not too bad at all. Personally the year wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad either, what with getting engaged and finally getting the house on the market.
But now it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to push things on further. My plans so far for this year seem to be &amp;lsquo;smash it&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>This week, as part of the &amp;ldquo;Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications&amp;rdquo; we held a workshop &amp;ldquo;Collective Social Awareness and Relevance (CSAR)&amp;rdquo;. Organising the workshop (along with Walter Colombo) over the last couple of months has been an interesting process - this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to get involved in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; workshop organisation, so this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the process up close.</description>

      <title>EPSRC Doctoral Award Fellowship</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really very pleased to be able to say that I have been awarded a 2013 EPSRC doctoral award fellowship. This means I&amp;rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to spend 12 months from October this year working independently on a research project of my own choosing. I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the connection between places and personality, analysing the large dataset collected through the Foursquare Personality app to try and build towards a recommendation system for places that uses personality as one of its key input signals.</description>

      <description>We are storming along with summer projects now, and starting to see some really good results.
Liam Turner (who is starting a PhD in the school in October) has been working hard to create a mobile version of the 4SQPersonality app. His work is coming along really well, with a great mobile HTML version now up and running, a native android wrapper working, and an iOS wrapper on its way. With any luck we&amp;rsquo;ll have mobile apps for both major platforms ready to be released before the summer is over.</description>

      <title>Social Media Lecture Experiment</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve very recently had the opportunity to be involved in a different kind of lecture here at the School of Computer Science and Informatics. For his final year project one of our third year students (Samuel Boyes) is assessing the use of modern technology, social networking and video conferencing as part of the traditional lecture. As I had already been asked a few weeks ago to give a guest lecture in Matt Williams&amp;rsquo; module Fundamentals of Computing with Java, on the topic of code maintainability/readability, we were presented with a nice opportunity to test out Sam&amp;rsquo;s theories in an actual lecture.</description>

      <description>Today we are finally starting to promote our latest experiment. It&amp;rsquo;s been online for about a month, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t told anyone about it while we&amp;rsquo;ve been finishing up the Year 2 deliverables for Recognition (the review is in a couple of weeks - fingers crossed!) Now however I can start publicly talking about it and encouraging people to take part and get involved!
We&amp;rsquo;re calling it the Foursquare Personality Experiment, and it&amp;rsquo;s available on the School of Computer Science &amp;amp; Informatics&amp;rsquo; website here:</description>

      <title>PhD Post-mortem - The Summary</title>
      <link>/2012/11/16/phd-post-mortem-the-summary/</link>

      <description>I originally wrote a whole bunch of posts (6!) about my PhD, what went wrong, how I felt about it, and so on. Then I read it all back and it was a bunch of hugely self-indulgent poorly written bollocks (what&amp;rsquo;s new?), so I decided not to publish it. Maybe sometime later I&amp;rsquo;ll get round to it, but for now, the tl-dr; is:
My viva was a car crash, my examiners hated my work, I got too depressed over the result to engage with the corrections process, had another viva, it was terrible but not as bad, I pulled it together and corrected it all in the end, thanks to some excellent support from everyone else.</description>

      <title>Talking about research</title>

      <description>As someone who spends most of their life elbow deep in research, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard to take a step back and view what you&amp;rsquo;re doing from the outside.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with my ability to communicate our work to a scientific audience. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trained (and have trained myself) to do over the last five or six years and so is something I find quite easy. The thought of having to explain what I do to a conference audience, or to the project partners in a meeting is something that I know I can cope with.</description>

      <description>Both of the summer projects that I&amp;rsquo;m supervising with Walter Colombo have now started, with two students joining us for 8 weeks over summer to gain some experience of the research environment and work on some (hopefully) interesting projects.
One of our students (James) is investigating the ranking of content on Twitter by pairwise comparison. He&amp;rsquo;s currently building a website to allow comparison of tweets and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get enough people to have a go at it that we can gather a large number of ratings of tweets.</description>

      <description>Note: I wrote this post just after the hackathon, but then forgot to actually publish it! 
There&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount I learnt from taking part in and helping to organise the foursquare hackathon here at the university that probably deserves its own post. I&amp;rsquo;ll split it into two parts, the taking part and the organisation.
Organising a hack event There were a couple of things I learnt from helping to organise the event that perhaps weren&amp;rsquo;t clear to begin with:</description>

      <title>Why write?</title>
      <link>/2011/08/24/why-write/</link>

      <guid>/2011/08/24/why-write/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly sensible question: why do I write anything here? There aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be that many people reading, if any. Probably the only people that come past are going to be the other people in COMSC having a nose around to see what people are putting on their websites, and the few visitors I get from the random google searches that seem to appear in my analytics reports every now and again.</description>

      <description>Over the summer, Ian and I are going to be supervising a summer project. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get a 2nd year undergraduate student for an 8 week project. I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck up a page about it here, and will post whenever there&amp;rsquo;s something interesting to see.</description>

      <title>Django &#43; Tweepy &#43; OAuth</title>

      <description>There is a lot of information out there that talks about putting Django and Tweepy together to make a Twitter web app. I read a lot of it recently, and although a lot of it is helpful some of it can be quite complicated or out of date.
To make things simple, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create an example Django project that just contains the basics needed to get up and running.</description>

      <description>Next week we have the project partners coming over to Cardiff for a workshop. Stu and myself were discussing that we should have some way to display information throughout the day, something that makes it easy to pick out the main themes of talks etc. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Wordle as a way of displaying text, so we thought it would be nice if we could have a dynamic Wordle displayed that people could add to throughout the workshop.</description>
