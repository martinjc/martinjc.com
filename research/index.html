I am a lecturer at the School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University.I'm programme leader for the MSc in Computational Journalism, and also senior personal tutor for all taught postgraduate students. I mainly do work that falls under the umbrella of the Mobile and Social Computing group.

My main research is therefore in the areas of human behaviour, looking at social, mobile and pervasive computing, ad-hoc and opportunistic networks and information dissemination - if there’s a scenario where people and computers mix and interact, that’s where I get involved. I’m also keen to investigate the use of computer science, social media, and data science within Journalism, as both a tool for improving communication and storytelling, and as an input and tool for data gathering, story creation and newsroom workflows.</p><p>I have a background in high performance computing, and am keen on using the massive computational power available today to further social computing research.</p><p>Recently I was working on a 12 month EPSRC Fellowship (2013 Doctoral Award Prize) examining the relationship between an individual’s personality (in terms of the OCEAN five-factor personality model) and the places they visit or check in to. Some work on this has already been <a href=http://martinjc.com/research/publications/ >published</a>, and more papers are in preparation. It is hoped that this work will lead to a novel place recommendation system which uses personality as a major signal to recommend new venues to users.</p><p>I’m also co-organiser (and majestic overlord) of the school’s <a href=http://mobisoc.cs.cf.ac.uk>Mobile and Social Computing Research</a> ‘group’. We organise bi-monthly informal discussion sessions for all interested staff and PhD students, and monthly formal seminars/talks on topics of interest to the group. I used to be co-organiser with <a href=http://www.mattjw.net/ >Dr Matthew Williams</a>, but he left.</p><p>As well as this, I have served as reviewer and on committees for many <a href=http://martinjc.com/research/commembe/ >journals and conferences</a>.</p><h2 id=past-research>Past Research</h2><p>Prior to my fellowship, I was <a href=http://martinjc.com/research/past-research/recognition/ >working</a> on the <a href=http://www.recognition-project.eu/ >Recognition</a> project, an EU FP7 project attempting to use relevance and human cognitive processes within IT systems to improve content dissemination and filtering. The work included areas such as how human decision making processes relate to twitter and micro-blogging, and examining the relationship between spatial places/venues and people in terms of both their personality and the expression they use towards the places they’ve been.</p><p>Before the Recognition project, I spent a year and a half <a href=http://martinjc.com/research/past-research/socialnets/ >working</a> on the <a href=http://www.social-nets.eu/ >SocialNets</a> project, another EU FP7 project concerning pervasive adaptation looking to improve mobile and ad-hoc systems using social network information and adaptive strategies.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
