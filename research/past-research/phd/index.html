The main focus of my research has been on the hybrid programming model, combining message passing programming (using MPI) with shared memory threading (using OpenMP).</p><p>I completed work on a hybrid MPI/OpenMP Molecular Dynamics (MD) application, the performance analysis of this code found that the hybrid model can deliver performance benefits, depending on the system interconnect used within a HPC cluster. I followed this with an analysis of a hybrid version of a real world MD application: DL_POLY. Results from both these codes have been <a href=http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/M.J.Chorley/research/publications/ >published</a> recently. Following this I worked towards creating a performance model describing the performance of hybrid and pure MPI MD codes.</p><p>My thesis was examined by Professor <a href=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/john.r.gurd/ >John Gurd</a> of Manchester University and Professor <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/Staff/BusinessCard/?name=ns.scott">Stan Scott</a> of Queens University Belfast.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
