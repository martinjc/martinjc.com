The project was mainly concerned with embedding self awareness in ICT systems, by using and understanding human cognitive principles.</p><p>Our work on the project was focused on trying to understand and classify elements of human behaviour as they relate to activities such as content consumption or geo-spatial movement. The hope is that this information can drive better recommendation systems.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
