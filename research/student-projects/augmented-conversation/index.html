The basic idea of the project is to develop a framework which will take a conversation as input and deliver relevant search results as output. We envisage a scenario where people are able to take part in a conversation and as the conversation progresses relevant content is retrieved from the web and displayed to the participants.</p><p>[caption id=”attachment_196” align=”aligncenter” width=”407” caption=”Overview of the Augmented Conversation project idea”]<a href=http://martinchorley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Overview2.png><img src=http://martinchorley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Overview2.png alt="Augmented Conversation overview"></a>[/caption]</p><p>Our summer student Nick Horne did a great job of creating some prototype software that successfully demonstrated proof of concept. He created a framework that now allows experimentation and evaluation of different algorithms for creating search queries and presenting and analysing the results.</p><p>Ian is now following this up this summer with another project to consider the automatic evaluation of returned search results when compared to the input text.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
