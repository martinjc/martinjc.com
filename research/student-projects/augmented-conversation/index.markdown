Over the summer of 2012Â [Ian Cooper](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Cooper/) and I supervised a summer project on the topic of "_augmented conversation_". The basic idea of the project is to develop a framework which will take a conversation as input and deliver relevant search results as output. We envisage a scenario where people are able to take part in a conversation and as the conversation progresses relevant content is retrieved from the web and displayed to the participants.

Our summer student Nick Horne did a great job of creating some prototype software that successfully demonstrated proof of concept. He created a framework that now allows experimentation and evaluation of different algorithms for creating search queries and presenting and analysing the results.

Ian is now following this up this summer with another project to consider the automatic evaluation of returned search results when compared to the input text.
