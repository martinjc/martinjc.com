He is now analysing this data to discover the aspects that make a city individual, or make it the same as everywhere else. An interactive website for exploring aspects of the data should be online by the end of the project.</p><p>MobiSoc sponsored Summer Project - <strong>4SQPersonality Mobile App</strong> - Liam Turner</p><p>Liam created a mobile version of the 4SQPersonality experiment, to try and disseminate the research further, engage with the public, and promote the results. His mobile app can be used by anyone to discover the personality profile of the venues surrounding them, while Foursquare users can login to personalise the results, and take the Five Factor personality test.</p><h1 id=section-1>2012</h1><p>CUROP Summer Project - <strong>Retweet Analysis in Twitter</strong>  - Tim Miller-Williams</p><p>Tim built a system to retrieve retweets on a particular topic from Twitter, created a network of retweets, the authors of those tweets and the users that retweeted them, then performed a community detection analysis on this network.</p><p>MobiSoc sponsored Summer Project - <strong>Twitter Ranking by Comparison</strong> - James Briggs</p><p>James investigated the ranking of tweets by pairwise comparison, creating a user-participatory experiment in which tweets are rated against one another. He then experimented with various rating algorithms and strategies in order to examine the popularity of tweets on particular topics.</p><h1 id=section-2>2011</h1><p>CUROP Summer Project - **Augmented Conversation **- Nicholas Horne</p><p>Nicholas  developed a framework which will take a conversation as input and deliver relevant search results as output. The framework allows experimentation and evaluation of different algorithms for creating search queries and presenting and analysing the results.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
