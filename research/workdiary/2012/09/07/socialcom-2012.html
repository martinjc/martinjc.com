This is not that post however; that will take a little longer to write as there were quite a few really interesting and relevant talks to round up. I also had some good discussions about the work we’ve been doing, the work we’re planning to do and some of the work that others are doing.</p><p>This post is instead just to gather together some of the stuff I’ve done linked to the conference. I presented the initial results from our <a href=http://martinjc.com/2012/05/18/tweetcues-twitter-experiment/ >Twitter experiment</a>, which was accepted as a short paper “Better the tweeter you know: social signals on Twitter”. The slides of my presentation are below, while the <a href=http://martinjc.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/chorley2012.pdf>paper is available</a> (or from the <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.27>publisher</a>). The code for the experiment is on <a href=https://github.com/martinjc/tweetcues-exp>github here</a>, and the data that came from the experiment will be released as soon as we’ve finished analysis for the journal paper that we’re currently working on.</p><p>** <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/martinchorley/tweetcues-better-the-tweeter-you-know-social-signals-on-twitter>Tweetcues - Better the tweeter you know: social signals on Twitter</a> ** from <strong><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/martinchorley>Martin Chorley</a></strong></p></div></div></div></body></html>
