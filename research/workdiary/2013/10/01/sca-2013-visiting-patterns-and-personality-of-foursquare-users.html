The presentation seemed to go really well - I think it’s the strongest work I’ve done yet, and so it was easy to talk well and with confidence about it, which led to a nice talk. There was also plenty of discussion after the talk, with a lot of good comments and questions from the audience, which suggests that most people were quite interested in the research. I pitched it as a WIP paper, describing what the ultimate aim of the project is - very much recycling the talk I gave to the interview panel for my <a href=http://martinjc.com/2013/08/16/epsrc-doctoral-award-fellowship/ >fellowship</a> proposal. I think it certainly got a few people interested who’ll look to follow the project as it unfolds over the next couple of months.</p><p>After lunch there was an extra bonus when we discovered a beer vending machine in the hotel - what better way to celebrate a successful conference presentation than a cold beer in the sun?</p></div></div></div></body></html>
