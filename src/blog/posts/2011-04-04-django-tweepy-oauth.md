There is a lot of information out there that talks about putting Django and Tweepy together to make a Twitter web app. I read a lot of it recently, and although a lot of it is helpful some of it can be quite complicated or out of date.

To make things simple, I thought I'd create an example Django project that just contains the basics needed to get up and running.

The 'DjangoTweepy' project, hosted on [Github here](https://github.com/martinjc/DjangoTweepy) contains all the code needed to get up and running with a Twitter web app using Django and Tweepy. Download it and follow the instructions to get up and running quickly, or with a bit of hacking add the 'twitter_auth' app to your existing projects.
