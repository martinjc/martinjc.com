I've thrown up a [post](http://compj.cs.cf.ac.uk/2015/01/05/empty-properties-postcodes/) on [compj.cs.cf.ac.uk](http://compj.cs.cf.ac.uk) about some work we've done looking at empty properties in Cardiff. I'll add further posts over the coming weeks about other data analysis we've done on this topic, and new work looking at the Welsh Assembly.
