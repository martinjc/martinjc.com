So I finally started writing again up there, but it all seems so incongruous with the post down below, which still makes me cry whenever I read it, so I think there's some sort of buffer needed between the super-emotional 'my mum died' stuff and the totally fluffy "here's a bit of useful code" stuff so here's a break of sorts. I didn't write this on the 16th March, but that's very much a date connected with the start of coronavirus lockdown madness for me, so I cheated this post into this date. Bite me.
