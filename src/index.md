# hello



{% insertImage "img/headshot.jpg", "me" "headshot"%}

I am Dr Martin Chorley.

I'm a Reader at the [School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/), Cardiff University. I am the Dean of Education for the [College of Physical Sciences and Engineering](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/colleges/physical-sciences-engineering), which means I look after our taught programmes and students within the College, and work with our seven academic schools on matters of academic quality, teaching and learning, and student experience.

Iâ€™m programme leader for the [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc), our innovative joint-honours degree with the [School of Journalism, Media and Culture (JOMEC)](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture). I helped design the course with colleagues from JOMEC and teach on many of the modules.

I'm co-organiser of the [European Data and Computational Journalism Conference](http://datajconf.com/), the fourth edition of which will be held in Zurich in June 2023. I helped run the [PyDiff](http://www.pydiff.wales/) meetups here in Cardiff, and I'm also co-founder of the [South Wales x South West](https://twitter.com/hh_swxsw) chapter of [Hacks/Hackers](https://hackshackers.com/), which held [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-South-Wales-x-South-West/) in Cardiff and Bristol bringing together journalists and technologists to rethink the future of news and information. 

I'm interested in people and computers, so that is where most of my scholarship is focused. A lot of my recent [research](research/) is looking at modern journalism and computer science education, with work in the area of Computational and Data Journalism. 

This site has details of my [research](research/), [publications](research/), [teaching](teaching/) and the semi-occasional rambling [blog](blog/) post.
