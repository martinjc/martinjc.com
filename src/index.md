# hello

{% insertImage "img/headshot", "me" %}

I am Dr Martin Chorley.

I'm a Reader at the [School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/), Cardiff University. I am the Director of Learning and Teaching for the school, which means I look after our Undergraduate and Taught Postgraduate programmes and students.

Iâ€™m programme leader for the [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc), our innovative joint-honours degree with the [School of Journalism, Media and Culture (JOMEC)](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture). I helped design the course with colleagues from JOMEC and teach on many of the modules.

I'm co-organiser of the [European Data and Computational Journalism Conference](http://datajconf.com/), the third edition of which was held in Malaga in 2019. I helped run the [PyDiff](http://www.pydiff.wales/) meetups here in Cardiff, and attempt to improve student and staff involvement in the local tech scene. I'm also co-founder of the [South Wales x South West](https://twitter.com/hh_swxsw) chapter of [Hacks/Hackers](https://hackshackers.com/), we hold [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-South-Wales-x-South-West/) in Cardiff and Bristol bringing together journalists and technologists to rethink the future of news and information. 

I have recently formed a Computer Science Scholarship group in the School, which is aiming to improve knowledge transfer of innovative and best-practice Computer Science teaching both inside and outside the School, and to carry out more research around Computer Science and Software Engineering education. Our group has recently presented papers at a number of educational conferences in the UK.

I'm interested in people and computers, so that is where most of my research is focused. A lot of my recent [research](research/) is looking at modern journalism and computer science education, with work in the area of Computational and Data Journalism. I am also interested in analysis of human behaviour as exposed through social network data, and interactions between people, systems and places.

This site has details of my [research](research/), [publications](research/), [teaching](teaching/) and the semi-occasional rambling [blog](blog/) post.
