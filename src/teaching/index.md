I am the Director of Learning and Teaching (DLT) for the School of Computer Science and Informatics, which means I am responsible for the student experience and academic quality and standards across all of our taught programmes and work with the Head of School to determine and implement our teaching strategy. I sit on the School Board and the Senior Management Team, chair the Board of Studies, liaise with our External Advisory Board, and sit on our Teaching, Learning and Academic Quality Committee. 

I had significant input into the project that created the [Data Science Academy](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/data-science-academy), and I am a member of the Data Science Academy steering group. I also serve on the DSA service design board.

Outside of the School I work with colleagues across the college and beyond through the Education and Students, DLT and DPGT forums. I also represent the College of Physical Sciences and Engineering (PSE) on the steering group for the Digital Education Programme.

I formed and now chair the Computer Science Scholarship group within the School. We meet regularly to discuss educational issues, plan educational research, discuss and create scholarly outputs, and implement knowledge sharing and teaching training within the School. Recently we have begun a set of School wide teaching seminars for the sharing and discussion of teaching experiences.

In the recent past I was the Deputy DLT in the School, and spent a lot of time focused on Postgraduate students, working as the chair of the Postgraduate Operations Team, Senior Personal Tutor for Taught Postgraduate students, and the Student Rep Coordinator for the postgrad Student-Staff Panel.

I'm the MSc Programme Leader for the [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc), a joint course between the [School of Computer Science & Informatics](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/) and the [School of Journalism, Media and Culture](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture) here at Cardiff University, a programme I co-designed.

I am currently an external examiner for Exeter University, for their MSc Computer Science, MSc Computer Science with Business, MSc Data Science, and MSc Data Science with Business.


## Autumn Semester

I am currently part of the teaching team for [Fundamentals of Programming (CMT120)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT120/20A.html), primarily teaching front-end web development. This is a core module for MSc Computing, MSc Computing and IT Management and MSc Computational and Data Journalism. I also contribute to [Computational Thinking (CMT119)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT119/20A.html) and other modules in our generalist masters programmes.

I was previously Module Leader for [Web Application Development (CMT112)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT112.html). This module was core for the MSc Computing, MSc Computing and IT Management, and the MSc Computational and Data Journalism programmes, and at times was an optional module for students on the MSc Data Science and Analytics. It has now been subsumed into the larger 'Fundamentals of Programming' module.



## Spring Semester

I am Module Leader for [Data Visualisation (CMT218)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/CMT218.html), a core module for MSc Data Science and Analytics which is also an optional module for several of the other MSc programmes.

I also co-teach the [Digital Investigation (MCT542)](http://handbooks.data.cardiff.ac.uk/module/MCT542.html) module on MSc Computational and Data Journalism.
