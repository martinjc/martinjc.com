      <description>So. 2013. That was an alright year. Finished the Recognition project, finally graduated, got a 12 month fellowship, started some interesting projects, and pushed on with the new MSc with JOMEC. Professionally, not too bad at all. Personally the year wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad either, what with getting engaged and finally getting the house on the market.
But now it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to push things on further. My plans so far for this year seem to be &amp;lsquo;smash it&amp;rsquo;.</description>
