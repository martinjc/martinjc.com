      <description>Last week I attended WowMom 2011 in Lucca, Italy. The conference was pretty good, but I was mainly there for the Autonomic and Opportunistic Computing (AOC) workshop where I was presenting some work, as I mentioned in an earlier post. The workshop was really interesting, a lot of the work was relevant to work we&amp;rsquo;d done in the past on the SocialNets project and work we&amp;rsquo;re doing in the future with the Recognition project.</description>

      <description>So I mentioned something about keeping busy? Yeah, well&amp;hellip;.
A while back I spent a couple of months playing around with an idea that we thought could make an interesting bit of research. It started with a simple modification to a protocol proposed by someone else (Gavidia et al, A gossip-based distributed news service for wireless mesh networks), where we added some elements of self-adaptation and cooperation. As things sometimes go, the results were quite good but not outstanding and we had more pressing things to look at, so we dropped it and moved onto something else.</description>
