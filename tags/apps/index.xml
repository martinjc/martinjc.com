      <description>Wow. I thought Saturday was busy, but I was wrong. Saturday was a cake walk compared to the crazy nightmare that was Sunday. The challenge of trying to get something (anything) working before the app submission deadline was incredible. Coding was fast and intense, and required a lot of good communication and fast thinking. Unfortunately we hit a few roadblocks that slowed us down (2 hours debugging problems with django&amp;rsquo;s static file serving really didn&amp;rsquo;t help, neither did jQuery mobile being an absolute pain in the rear end), but by the end of the day we had a nice looking site with some actual working functionality.</description>

      <description>Another update on the summer project? Already? Yes.
The project is really cracking on. We&amp;rsquo;re two weeks from the end and beginning to see the results roll in, every meeting brings a new version of the software with more functionality. Nick has successfully written a nice framework that allows us to input conversations and automatically retrieve search results based on the topics of those conversations. Even the voice input works (almost) and we&amp;rsquo;ve got enough time to try and move on to some content extraction ideas.</description>

      <title>Losing Weight in 2011 continued... Libra</title>

      <description>Another of the very useful apps I&amp;rsquo;ve been using since the start of the &amp;ldquo;New Regime&amp;rdquo; is Libra. It totally makes up for the crappy progress graphs on the MyFitnessPal website or in the mobile app.
It&amp;rsquo;s an app that has a singular purpose: it&amp;rsquo;s just for tracking weight. But it does it very well. You enter a weight for every day, it works out statistics based on those weights, calculates the trend value for your weight, (so smoothes out daily fluctuations caused by water intake etc), and predicts when you&amp;rsquo;ll hit your target.</description>

      <title>Losing Weight in 2011 continued... My Fitness Pal</title>

      <description>(The first in a series of posts on apps I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful under &amp;lsquo;the new regime&amp;rsquo;)
One of the best apps/services I&amp;rsquo;ve found for general fitness and nutrition and weight lossÂ is MyFitnessPal. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made quite as good progress without it.
The main selling point of the service is that it allows you to track what you eat and what exercise you do, in order to monitor and help regulate your calorific intake.</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of the year I&amp;rsquo;ve been living under what we&amp;rsquo;ve been calling &amp;lsquo;the new regime&amp;rsquo;. This &amp;lsquo;new regime&amp;rsquo; basically involves not living like a fat useless slob, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting fit, eating healthily and losing weight. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve lost over 10kg and can now run around the park a few times without collapsing to the floor clutching at my chest and screaming about ambulances, so I&amp;rsquo;d say its going pretty well.</description>
