      <description>Another update on the summer project? Already? Yes.
The project is really cracking on. We&amp;rsquo;re two weeks from the end and beginning to see the results roll in, every meeting brings a new version of the software with more functionality. Nick has successfully written a nice framework that allows us to input conversations and automatically retrieve search results based on the topics of those conversations. Even the voice input works (almost) and we&amp;rsquo;ve got enough time to try and move on to some content extraction ideas.</description>

      <description>Some excellent news yesterday as we&amp;rsquo;ve heard that we&amp;rsquo;ve got the CUROP funding for the summer project that I previously mentioned.
All being well, it should start within the next couple of weeks, so I&amp;rsquo;ll update with the progress once there is some!</description>

      <description>Over the summer, Ian and I are going to be supervising a summer project. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get a 2nd year undergraduate student for an 8 week project. I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck up a page about it here, and will post whenever there&amp;rsquo;s something interesting to see.</description>
