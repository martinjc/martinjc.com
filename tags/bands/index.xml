      <description>Last Saturday I went along to The Globe in Roath, accompanied by my excellent musical companion Ms. Jones (and joined later on by our token northener Mark)Â to watch a number of bands that we&amp;rsquo;d seen before, but in a new setting. This is a review of that what happened there.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the venue, The Globe. The Globe is not the worst venue in Cardiff (Bogiez/Barfly, The SU Great Hall).</description>
