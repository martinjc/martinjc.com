      <description>Google Web History has now been recording all of the searches I made in Google since about 2005. Obviously 6 years of search queries and results is a phenomenal amount of data, and it would be nice to get hold of it all to see what I could make of it. Fortunately Google make the data available as an RSS feed, although it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly well documented.
(caution - many &amp;lsquo;ifs&amp;rsquo; coming up next)</description>
