      <description>As someone who spends most of their life elbow deep in research, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard to take a step back and view what you&amp;rsquo;re doing from the outside.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with my ability to communicate our work to a scientific audience. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trained (and have trained myself)Â to do over the last five or six years and so is something I find quite easy. The thought of having to explain what I do to a conference audience, or to the project partners in a meeting is something that I know I can cope with.</description>
