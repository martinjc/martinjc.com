      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really very pleased to be able to say that I have been awarded a 2013 EPSRC doctoral award fellowship. This means I&amp;rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to spend 12 months from October this year working independently on a research project of my own choosing. I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the connection between places and personality, analysing the large dataset collected through the Foursquare Personality app to try and build towards a recommendation system for places that uses personality as one of its key input signals.</description>
