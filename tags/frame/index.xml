      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on some notes for a beginners LaTeX course that I&amp;rsquo;m giving for the University Graduate College this week. In a temporary fit of insanity I decided it would be nice to write all the slides in LaTeX, so that I can distribute the source to the students so they get some real world LaTeX examples to go along with the course notes.
I was attempting to make handouts for the students using the great handoutWithNotes package.</description>
