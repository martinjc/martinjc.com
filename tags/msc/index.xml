      <description>Last week I gave a quick lightning talk at UnifiedDiff - a local tech meetup here in Cardiff. The main point of the talk was to try and recruit more industry involvement for our new MSc in Computational Journalism - preferably by getting some web developers and software engineers in to give guest lectures on the tools, languages and processes they use.
The talk went well, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had several offers from people wanting to get involved and add some real value to the course, which is brilliant.</description>
