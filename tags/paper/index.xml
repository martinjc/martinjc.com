      <description>Our paper examining the link between individual personality and the places people visit has just been published in Computers in Human Behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s open access, so you can go read it for free, now! 
In an experiment we ran previously, we asked users of Foursquare to take a personality test and give us access to their checkin history. The personality test gives us a measure of how each person scores for five different factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</description>

      <description>Update 13/01/15: the paper containing the research described below is currently available from the HICSS website
This post is one I&amp;rsquo;m cross-posting both here and on the MobiSoc blog. Here, because it&amp;rsquo;s my personal translation of one of our latest research papers, and there because it&amp;rsquo;s a very good paper mostly written and driven by Roger Whitaker, so deserves an &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; blog post!
A lot of use is made of Crowdsourcing in both business and academia.</description>
