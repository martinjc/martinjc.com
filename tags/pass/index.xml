      <description>This is a post I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write for a very long time. A very, very, long time. As I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting so long I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with the good news: on the 30th October 2012 I finally received confirmation that my examiners had accepted my PhD corrections and I should be approved for my degree. I&amp;rsquo;m Dr Martin Chorley.
Exactly how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write this depends on your point of view.</description>
