      <description>A very good week this week, in that I was only in work for 3 days, but still accomplished a lot. Through some convenient meetings I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get a whole mess of projects lined up for the next year or so, and I came out of the week on Friday very eager to get cracking on things.
Monday 8.5.17 This week started with our Assessment and Feedback focused teaching &amp;lsquo;away day&amp;rsquo;, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t really an away day because we didn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere, but which was incredibly useful nonetheless.</description>
