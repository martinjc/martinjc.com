      <title>Personality and Places</title>

      <description>Our paper examining the link between individual personality and the places people visit has just been published in Computers in Human Behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s open access, so you can go read it for free, now! 
In an experiment we ran previously, we asked users of Foursquare to take a personality test and give us access to their checkin history. The personality test gives us a measure of how each person scores for five different factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</description>

      <description>Update 13/01/15: the paper containing the research described below is currently available from the HICSS website
This post is one I&amp;rsquo;m cross-posting both here and on the MobiSoc blog. Here, because it&amp;rsquo;s my personal translation of one of our latest research papers, and there because it&amp;rsquo;s a very good paper mostly written and driven by Roger Whitaker, so deserves an &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; blog post!
A lot of use is made of Crowdsourcing in both business and academia.</description>

      <title>How do people decide whether or not to read a tweet? </title>

      <description>It turns out that an existing relationship with the author of the tweet is one of the main factors influencing how someone decides whether or not to read a tweet. At the same time, a large number associated with a tweet can also make the tweet more attractive to readers.
Our latest Open Access research has discovered how much effect the information about a tweet has on whether people decide to read it or not.</description>

      <description>Last month I was invited along as a guest speaker for the regular sciSCREEN event held at Chapter Arts Centre. This is a great event that combines a showing of a movie with a discussion session about the themes and science issues presented in the film. A short essay based on my rambling improvised talk is below, and has been posted on the sciSCREEN website here.
&amp;lsquo;Her&amp;rsquo; and Artificial Intelligence &amp;lsquo;Her&amp;rsquo; presents us with a near-future world in which the way we interact with computers has moved on.</description>

      <description>So. 2013. That was an alright year. Finished the Recognition project, finally graduated, got a 12 month fellowship, started some interesting projects, and pushed on with the new MSc with JOMEC. Professionally, not too bad at all. Personally the year wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad either, what with getting engaged and finally getting the house on the market.
But now it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to push things on further. My plans so far for this year seem to be &amp;lsquo;smash it&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Nice work by [@martinjc](https://twitter.com/martinjc) on Foursquare checkins and personality # sca2013 [pic.twitter.com/9afebFrzYS](http://t.co/9afebFrzYS) — Shaun Lawson (@shaunlawson) [October 1, 2013](https://twitter.com/shaunlawson/statuses/384979369175027712) Today was presentation day for me at SCA 2013 - I was presenting the initial results of the Foursquare experiment, which has now been running for a while. The presentation seemed to go really well - I think it&amp;rsquo;s the strongest work I&amp;rsquo;ve done yet, and so it was easy to talk well and with confidence about it, which led to a nice talk.</description>

      <description>This week, as part of the &amp;ldquo;Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications&amp;rdquo; we held a workshop &amp;ldquo;Collective Social Awareness and Relevance (CSAR)&amp;rdquo;. Organising the workshop (along with Walter Colombo) over the last couple of months has been an interesting process - this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to get involved in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; workshop organisation, so this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the process up close.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really very pleased to be able to say that I have been awarded a 2013 EPSRC doctoral award fellowship. This means I&amp;rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to spend 12 months from October this year working independently on a research project of my own choosing. I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the connection between places and personality, analysing the large dataset collected through the Foursquare Personality app to try and build towards a recommendation system for places that uses personality as one of its key input signals.</description>

      <description>We are storming along with summer projects now, and starting to see some really good results.
Liam Turner (who is starting a PhD in the school in October) has been working hard to create a mobile version of the 4SQPersonality app. His work is coming along really well, with a great mobile HTML version now up and running, a native android wrapper working, and an iOS wrapper on its way. With any luck we&amp;rsquo;ll have mobile apps for both major platforms ready to be released before the summer is over.</description>

      <description>Today we are finally starting to promote our latest experiment. It&amp;rsquo;s been online for about a month, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t told anyone about it while we&amp;rsquo;ve been finishing up the Year 2 deliverables for Recognition (the review is in a couple of weeks - fingers crossed!) Now however I can start publicly talking about it and encouraging people to take part and get involved!
We&amp;rsquo;re calling it the Foursquare Personality Experiment, and it&amp;rsquo;s available on the School of Computer Science &amp;amp; Informatics&amp;rsquo; website here:</description>

      <title>PhD Post-mortem - The Summary</title>
      <link>https://martinjc.com/2012/11/16/phd-post-mortem-the-summary/</link>

      <guid>https://martinjc.com/2012/11/16/phd-post-mortem-the-summary/</guid>
      <description>I originally wrote a whole bunch of posts (6!) about my PhD, what went wrong, how I felt about it, and so on. Then I read it all back and it was a bunch of hugely self-indulgent poorly written bollocks (what&amp;rsquo;s new?), so I decided not to publish it. Maybe sometime later I&amp;rsquo;ll get round to it, but for now, the tl-dr; is:
My viva was a car crash, my examiners hated my work, I got too depressed over the result to engage with the corrections process, had another viva, it was terrible but not as bad, I pulled it together and corrected it all in the end, thanks to some excellent support from everyone else.</description>

      <description>This is a post I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write for a very long time. A very, very, long time. As I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting so long I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with the good news: on the 30th October 2012 I finally received confirmation that my examiners had accepted my PhD corrections and I should be approved for my degree. I&amp;rsquo;m Dr Martin Chorley.
Exactly how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write this depends on your point of view.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from SocialCom 2012 and figured it was worth a post to round it all up. This is not that post however; that will take a little longer to write as there were quite a few really interesting and relevant talks to round up. I also had some good discussions about the work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, the work we&amp;rsquo;re planning to do and some of the work that others are doing.</description>

      <description>As someone who spends most of their life elbow deep in research, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard to take a step back and view what you&amp;rsquo;re doing from the outside.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with my ability to communicate our work to a scientific audience. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trained (and have trained myself) to do over the last five or six years and so is something I find quite easy. The thought of having to explain what I do to a conference audience, or to the project partners in a meeting is something that I know I can cope with.</description>

      <description>Both of the summer projects that I&amp;rsquo;m supervising with Walter Colombo have now started, with two students joining us for 8 weeks over summer to gain some experience of the research environment and work on some (hopefully) interesting projects.
One of our students (James) is investigating the ranking of content on Twitter by pairwise comparison. He&amp;rsquo;s currently building a website to allow comparison of tweets and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get enough people to have a go at it that we can gather a large number of ratings of tweets.</description>

      <description>I was fully intending to try and live-blog the progress of the foursquare hackathon today, even going as far as to install a live blog plugin, but things have been going very quickly and we&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting the coding hard so I just haven&amp;rsquo;t had time!
We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get a decent crowd in, a roughly 50:50 split of people we already knew from the School and other people from elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Another update on the summer project? Already? Yes.
The project is really cracking on. We&amp;rsquo;re two weeks from the end and beginning to see the results roll in, every meeting brings a new version of the software with more functionality. Nick has successfully written a nice framework that allows us to input conversations and automatically retrieve search results based on the topics of those conversations. Even the voice input works (almost) and we&amp;rsquo;ve got enough time to try and move on to some content extraction ideas.</description>

      <description>I figure it&amp;rsquo;s about time I posted an update on the summer project that myself and Ian are supervising. Our summer student Nick is now two weeks into the project and seems to be getting to grips nicely with the problem. He also seems to be coping pretty well with two novice supervisors babbling away at him whenever we meet up! If he leaves the office without being completely overwhelmed with information I think it&amp;rsquo;s been a successful meeting.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended WowMom 2011 in Lucca, Italy. The conference was pretty good, but I was mainly there for the Autonomic and Opportunistic Computing (AOC) workshop where I was presenting some work, as I mentioned in an earlier post. The workshop was really interesting, a lot of the work was relevant to work we&amp;rsquo;d done in the past on the SocialNets project and work we&amp;rsquo;re doing in the future with the Recognition project.</description>

      <description>Over the summer, Ian and I are going to be supervising a summer project. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get a 2nd year undergraduate student for an 8 week project. I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck up a page about it here, and will post whenever there&amp;rsquo;s something interesting to see.</description>

      <guid>https://martinjc.com/2011/03/28/fun-with-django.../</guid>
      <description>One of the latest ideas we are working on for the new project is looking at how providing different amounts of information affects our perception of content. Even in pure implementation terms this is interestingly unlike any of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last few years, most of which was simulation based. &amp;ldquo;Code a simulation, run the simulation, analyse the results&amp;rdquo; has been a pattern of work since the beginning of my PhD and beyond.</description>
