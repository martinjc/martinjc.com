      <description>Nice work by [@martinjc](https://twitter.com/martinjc) on Foursquare checkins and personality # sca2013 [pic.twitter.com/9afebFrzYS](http://t.co/9afebFrzYS) â€” Shaun Lawson (@shaunlawson) [October 1, 2013](https://twitter.com/shaunlawson/statuses/384979369175027712) Today was presentation day for me at SCA 2013 - I was presenting the initial results of the Foursquare experiment, which has now been running for a while. The presentation seemed to go really well - I think it&amp;rsquo;s the strongest work I&amp;rsquo;ve done yet, and so it was easy to talk well and with confidence about it, which led to a nice talk.</description>

      <description>This week, as part of the &amp;ldquo;Third International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications&amp;rdquo; we held a workshop &amp;ldquo;Collective Social Awareness and Relevance (CSAR)&amp;rdquo;. Organising the workshop (along with Walter Colombo) over the last couple of months has been an interesting process - this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to get involved in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; workshop organisation, so this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the process up close.</description>
