      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from SocialCom 2012 and figured it was worth a post to round it all up. This is not that post however; that will take a little longer to write as there were quite a few really interesting and relevant talks to round up. I also had some good discussions about the work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, the work we&amp;rsquo;re planning to do and some of the work that others are doing.</description>
